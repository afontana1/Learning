## Exploring General Topology with Python

Slide 1: Introduction to General Topology

General Topology is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of spaces and their properties. In Python, we can represent topological spaces using sets and functions.

```python
class TopologicalSpace:
    def __init__(self, points, open_sets):
        self.points = set(points)
        self.open_sets = set(open_sets)
    
    def is_open(self, subset):
        return subset in self.open_sets

# Example: Creating a simple topological space
points = {1, 2, 3, 4}
open_sets = [{}, {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}]
space = TopologicalSpace(points, open_sets)

print(space.is_open({1, 2}))  # True
print(space.is_open({1, 3}))  # False
```

Slide 2: Open Sets

Open sets are fundamental to topology. In a topological space, open sets define the structure of the space.

```python
def is_open_set(space, subset):
    return all(space.is_open(s) for s in space.open_sets if subset.issubset(s))

# Example: Checking if a set is open
points = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
open_sets = [{}, {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]
space = TopologicalSpace(points, open_sets)

print(is_open_set(space, {1, 2}))  # True
print(is_open_set(space, {1, 3}))  # False
```

Slide 3: Closed Sets

Closed sets are complements of open sets in a topological space.

```python
def is_closed_set(space, subset):
    complement = space.points - subset
    return is_open_set(space, complement)

# Example: Checking if a set is closed
points = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
open_sets = [{}, {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]
space = TopologicalSpace(points, open_sets)

print(is_closed_set(space, {3, 4, 5}))  # True
print(is_closed_set(space, {1, 2, 3}))  # False
```

Slide 4: Neighborhoods

A neighborhood of a point is an open set containing that point.

```python
def find_neighborhoods(space, point):
    return [s for s in space.open_sets if point in s]

# Example: Finding neighborhoods of a point
points = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
open_sets = [{}, {1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]
space = TopologicalSpace(points, open_sets)

print(find_neighborhoods(space, 2))  # [{1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}]
```

Slide 5: Continuous Functions

Continuous functions preserve the topological structure between spaces.

```python
def is_continuous(domain, codomain, func):
    for open_set in codomain.open_sets:
        preimage = {x for x in domain.points if func(x) in open_set}
        if not is_open_set(domain, preimage):
            return False
    return True

# Example: Checking if a function is continuous
domain = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])
codomain = TopologicalSpace({a, b}, [{}, {a}, {a, b}])
func = lambda x: a if x == 1 else b

print(is_continuous(domain, codomain, func))  # True
```

Slide 6: Homeomorphisms

Homeomorphisms are bijective continuous functions with continuous inverses.

```python
def is_homeomorphism(domain, codomain, func):
    if not is_continuous(domain, codomain, func):
        return False
    
    inverse_func = {func(x): x for x in domain.points}
    return is_continuous(codomain, domain, lambda y: inverse_func[y])

# Example: Checking if a function is a homeomorphism
domain = TopologicalSpace({1, 2}, [{}, {1}, {1, 2}])
codomain = TopologicalSpace({a, b}, [{}, {a}, {a, b}])
func = lambda x: a if x == 1 else b

print(is_homeomorphism(domain, codomain, func))  # True
```

Slide 7: Connectedness

A topological space is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets.

```python
def is_connected(space):
    for s in space.open_sets:
        complement = space.points - s
        if s and complement and is_open_set(space, complement):
            return False
    return True

# Example: Checking if a space is connected
connected_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1, 2, 3}])
disconnected_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])

print(is_connected(connected_space))  # True
print(is_connected(disconnected_space))  # False
```

Slide 8: Compactness

A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.

```python
def is_compact(space):
    def has_finite_subcover(cover):
        for i in range(1, len(cover) + 1):
            for subcover in itertools.combinations(cover, i):
                if set.union(*subcover) == space.points:
                    return True
        return False

    return all(has_finite_subcover(cover) 
               for cover in itertools.chain.from_iterable(
                   itertools.combinations(space.open_sets, r) 
                   for r in range(1, len(space.open_sets) + 1)
               ) if set.union(*cover) == space.points)

# Example: Checking if a space is compact
import itertools

compact_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2}, [{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}])
non_compact_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}])

print(is_compact(compact_space))  # True
print(is_compact(non_compact_space))  # False
```

Slide 9: Separation Axioms

Separation axioms define how well-separated points and sets are in a topological space.

```python
def is_t0(space):
    return all(any(p in s and q not in s or p not in s and q in s 
                   for s in space.open_sets)
               for p in space.points
               for q in space.points if p != q)

def is_t1(space):
    return all({q} in space.open_sets
               for p in space.points
               for q in space.points if p != q)

# Example: Checking separation axioms
t0_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}])
t1_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])

print(is_t0(t0_space))  # True
print(is_t1(t1_space))  # True
```

Slide 10: Metric Spaces

Metric spaces are a special type of topological space where distances between points are defined.

```python
import math

class MetricSpace(TopologicalSpace):
    def __init__(self, points, distance_func):
        self.points = set(points)
        self.distance = distance_func
        self.open_sets = self._generate_open_sets()

    def _generate_open_sets(self):
        open_sets = set()
        for center in self.points:
            for radius in [0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]:  # Example radii
                open_ball = {p for p in self.points if self.distance(center, p) < radius}
                open_sets.add(frozenset(open_ball))
        return open_sets

# Example: Creating a metric space (2D Euclidean space)
points = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]
distance = lambda p, q: math.sqrt((p[0] - q[0])**2 + (p[1] - q[1])**2)
metric_space = MetricSpace(points, distance)

print(metric_space.is_open(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 1)})))  # True
```

Slide 11: Hausdorff Spaces

Hausdorff spaces are topological spaces where any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets.

```python
def is_hausdorff(space):
    return all(any(p in s1 and q in s2 and s1.isdisjoint(s2)
                   for s1 in space.open_sets
                   for s2 in space.open_sets)
               for p in space.points
               for q in space.points if p != q)

# Example: Checking if a space is Hausdorff
hausdorff_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])
non_hausdorff_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3}, [{}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}])

print(is_hausdorff(hausdorff_space))  # True
print(is_hausdorff(non_hausdorff_space))  # False
```

Slide 12: Quotient Spaces

Quotient spaces are formed by identifying points in a topological space according to an equivalence relation.

```python
def create_quotient_space(space, equivalence_classes):
    quotient_points = frozenset(frozenset(ec) for ec in equivalence_classes)
    quotient_open_sets = {
        frozenset(ec for ec in quotient_points if any(p in s for p in ec))
        for s in space.open_sets
    }
    return TopologicalSpace(quotient_points, quotient_open_sets)

# Example: Creating a quotient space
original_space = TopologicalSpace({1, 2, 3, 4}, [{}, {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}])
equivalence_classes = [{1, 2}, {3, 4}]
quotient_space = create_quotient_space(original_space, equivalence_classes)

print(len(quotient_space.points))  # 2
print(len(quotient_space.open_sets))  # 4
```

Slide 13: Product Spaces

Product spaces are formed by taking the Cartesian product of two or more topological spaces.

```python
def create_product_space(space1, space2):
    product_points = {(p1, p2) for p1 in space1.points for p2 in space2.points}
    product_open_sets = {
        frozenset((p1, p2) for p1 in s1 for p2 in s2)
        for s1 in space1.open_sets
        for s2 in space2.open_sets
    }
    return TopologicalSpace(product_points, product_open_sets)

# Example: Creating a product space
space1 = TopologicalSpace({1, 2}, [{}, {1}, {1, 2}])
space2 = TopologicalSpace({a, b}, [{}, {a}, {a, b}])
product_space = create_product_space(space1, space2)

print(len(product_space.points))  # 4
print(len(product_space.open_sets))  # 9
```

Slide 14: Real-life Example: Network Topology

Topological concepts can be applied to network analysis, where nodes represent devices and edges represent connections.

```python
import networkx as nx

def create_network_topology(nodes, edges):
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_nodes_from(nodes)
    G.add_edges_from(edges)
    
    open_sets = [{n for n in G.nodes if nx.shortest_path_length(G, source=node, target=n) <= radius}
                 for node in G.nodes
                 for radius in range(nx.diameter(G) + 1)]
    
    return TopologicalSpace(set(G.nodes), open_sets)

# Example: Creating a network topology
nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
edges = [('A', 'B'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('D', 'A')]
network_space = create_network_topology(nodes, edges)

print(len(network_space.open_sets))  # Number of open sets in the network topology
```

Slide 15: Real-life Example: Image Processing

Topological data analysis can be applied to image processing for feature detection and pattern recognition.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import label

def create_image_topology(image, threshold):
    binary_image = image > threshold
    labeled_image, num_features = label(binary_image)
    
    points = set(range(num_features + 1))  # Include background as feature 0
    open_sets = [{i for i in points if np.any(labeled_image == i)}]
    
    for radius in range(1, max(image.shape)):
        for feature in points:
            dilated = np.zeros_like(labeled_image)
            mask = labeled_image == feature
            dilated[mask] = 1
            dilated = np.where(dilated == 1, radius, 0)
            open_set = {i for i in points if np.any(np.logical_and(labeled_image == i, dilated > 0))}
            open_sets.append(frozenset(open_set))
    
    return TopologicalSpace(points, open_sets)

# Example: Creating an image topology
image = np.random.rand(10, 10)
image_space = create_image_topology(image, threshold=0.5)

print(len(image_space.points))  # Number of features (including background)
print(len(image_space.open_sets))  # Number of open sets in the image topology
```
