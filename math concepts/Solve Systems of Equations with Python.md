## Solve Systems of Equations with Python

Slide 1: Solving Systems of Equations with Python

In this series, we'll explore how to use Python to solve systems of linear and non-linear equations. Solving such systems has numerous applications in various fields like physics, engineering, economics, and more.

Slide 2: What is a System of Equations?

A system of equations is a set of two or more equations involving multiple variables. The solution to the system is the set of values for the variables that satisfies all the equations simultaneously.

Slide 3: Linear Systems

Linear systems are systems where each equation is a linear combination of the variables. These can be solved using various methods like substitution, elimination, or matrix methods.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients and constants for two linear equations
a = np.array([[3, 2], [1, -1]]) 
b = np.array([14, 5])

# Solve the system using numpy.linalg.solve
x = np.linalg.solve(a, b)

print(f"Solution: x = {x[0]}, y = {x[1]}")
```

Slide 4: Non-Linear Systems

Non-linear systems involve equations that are not linear combinations of the variables. These often require numerical methods to find approximate solutions.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

# Define the system of non-linear equations
def equations(p):
    x, y = p
    return (x**2 + y**2 - 4, x**2 - y - 2)

# Initial guess for x and y
x0 = np.array([1, 1])

# Solve the system using scipy.optimize.fsolve
x = fsolve(equations, x0)

print(f"Solution: x = {x[0]}, y = {x[1]}")
```

Slide 5: Symbolic Math with SymPy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It can be used to solve systems of equations involving symbolic expressions.

Code:

```python
import sympy as sp

x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the system of equations
eq1 = x**2 + y**2 - 4
eq2 = x**2 - y - 2

# Solve the system symbolically
sol = sp.nonlinsolve([eq1, eq2], [x, y])

print(f"Solution: {sol}")
```

Slide 6: Graphing Systems

Sometimes it's useful to visualize the system of equations by graphing them. This can provide insights into the solution(s) and help verify numerical results.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)

# Define the equations
y1 = np.sqrt(4 - x**2)
y2 = x**2 - 2

# Plot the equations
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.plot(x, y1, label='x^2 + y^2 = 4')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='x^2 - y = 2')

# Find and plot the intersection point
idx = np.argwhere(np.diff(np.sign(y1 - y2))).flatten()
plt.plot(x[idx], y1[idx], 'ro')

plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Applications: Physics

Systems of equations arise naturally in physics problems involving multiple forces, conservation laws, or other constraints. Solving these systems allows us to find quantities of interest.

Slide 11: Checking Solutions

After obtaining a solution, it's good practice to verify that it satisfies all the equations in the system. This can catch errors and increase confidence in the result.

Code:

```python
# Define the system of equations
def equations(x, y):
    return (x**2 + y**2 - 4, x**2 - y - 2)

# Proposed solution
x0, y0 = 1, 1

# Check if the solution satisfies the equations
eq1, eq2 = equations(x0, y0)

print(f"Equation 1 evaluated at (x0, y0): {eq1}")
print(f"Equation 2 evaluated at (x0, y0): {eq2}")
```

Slide 12: Multiple Solutions

Some systems of equations may have multiple solutions, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions. Analyzing the nature of the equations can provide insights into the solution set.
