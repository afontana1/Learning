## Calculating Raptor 2 Engines Needed to Alter Earth Rotation
Slide 1: Earth's Rotation and SpaceX's Raptor 2 Engines

This presentation explores the intriguing question: How many SpaceX Raptor 2 engines would be needed to make a noticeable change in Earth's rotation? We'll approach this problem using mathematical modeling and physics principles, breaking down the complex issue into manageable parts. Our analysis will consider the Earth's rotational properties, the thrust capabilities of Raptor 2 engines, and the practical implications of such an endeavor.

Slide 2: Background: Earth's Rotation and Raptor 2 Engines

Earth rotates on its axis once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, known as a sidereal day. This rotation is incredibly stable due to the planet's enormous mass and angular momentum. The SpaceX Raptor 2 engine, designed for the Starship project, is one of the most powerful rocket engines ever created. It generates approximately 230 tons (2.25 MN) of thrust at sea level, using a full-flow staged combustion cycle with liquid methane and liquid oxygen as propellants.

Slide 3: Key Assumptions

To simplify our analysis, we'll make the following assumptions:

1. Earth is treated as a perfect sphere with uniform density.
2. We'll ignore atmospheric effects and consider the engines operating in vacuum.
3. The change in rotation will be measured over a short time period, allowing us to ignore long-term effects like tidal forces.
4. All Raptor 2 engines will be firing tangentially to Earth's surface at the equator.
5. We'll define a "noticeable change" as a 1-millisecond alteration in the length of a day.

Slide 4: Mathematical Formulation

We'll use the concept of angular momentum conservation to solve this problem. The change in Earth's angular velocity (ω) due to an applied torque (τ) over time (t) is given by:

Δω = (τ \* t) / I

Where I is Earth's moment of inertia. For a sphere, I = (2/5) \* M \* R^2, with M being Earth's mass and R its radius.

The torque applied by the engines is:

τ = F \* R

Where F is the total thrust force of all engines.

Slide 5: Problem Breakdown and Estimation

Let's break down our approach:

1. Calculate Earth's moment of inertia
2. Determine the angular velocity change for a 1 ms day length alteration
3. Calculate the required torque
4. Compute the number of Raptor 2 engines needed

We'll use the following values:

* Earth's mass (M) ≈ 5.97 × 10^24 kg
* Earth's radius (R) ≈ 6.37 × 10^6 m
* Earth's angular velocity (ω) ≈ 7.29 × 10^-5 rad/s
* Raptor 2 thrust in vacuum ≈ 2.45 MN

Slide 6: Python Code - Part 1

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
M_earth = 5.97e24  # kg
R_earth = 6.37e6   # m
omega = 7.29e-5    # rad/s
raptor2_thrust = 2.45e6  # N

# Calculate Earth's moment of inertia
I_earth = 0.4 * M_earth * R_earth**2

# Calculate angular velocity change for 1 ms day length alteration
day_length = 24 * 3600  # seconds
delta_omega = (2 * np.pi / (day_length**2)) * 0.001

# Calculate required torque
torque = I_earth * delta_omega / (24 * 3600)  # Apply torque for one day

print(f"Earth's moment of inertia: {I_earth:.2e} kg·m²")
print(f"Required angular velocity change: {delta_omega:.2e} rad/s")
print(f"Required torque: {torque:.2e} N·m")
```

Slide 7: Python Code - Part 2

```python
# Calculate number of Raptor 2 engines needed
num_engines = torque / (raptor2_thrust * R_earth)

# Calculate total thrust and fuel consumption
total_thrust = num_engines * raptor2_thrust
fuel_consumption = num_engines * 650  # kg/s, estimated Raptor 2 fuel consumption

print(f"Number of Raptor 2 engines needed: {num_engines:.2e}")
print(f"Total thrust required: {total_thrust:.2e} N")
print(f"Fuel consumption rate: {fuel_consumption:.2e} kg/s")

# Calculate fuel needed for one day of operation
fuel_per_day = fuel_consumption * 24 * 3600

print(f"Fuel needed for one day: {fuel_per_day:.2e} kg")
```

Slide 8: Real-World Applications

While altering Earth's rotation is impractical, the estimation techniques used in this problem have various real-world applications:

1. Space debris mitigation: Calculating the thrust needed to deorbit satellites or large debris.
2. Asteroid deflection: Estimating the force required to alter an asteroid's trajectory.
3. Spacecraft design: Determining the number of engines needed for various space missions.
4. Climate modeling: Understanding the effects of large-scale phenomena on Earth's rotation.
5. Geophysics: Studying the impact of natural events (e.g., earthquakes) on Earth's rotational properties.

Slide 9: Historical Context: Atomic Clock Precision

The ability to measure changes in Earth's rotation with millisecond precision is a relatively recent development. In 1955, Louis Essen and Jack Parry built the first accurate atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. This breakthrough allowed scientists to detect minute variations in Earth's rotation rate, revealing phenomena like the slowing of Earth's rotation due to tidal forces and the impact of large-scale weather patterns on rotation speed.

Slide 10: Made-up Trivia: The Great Sneeze Experiment

Imagine if everyone on Earth (approximately 7.9 billion people) sneezed simultaneously in the same direction. How much would this affect Earth's rotation?

To solve this, we need to consider:

1. Average mass expelled during a sneeze
2. Average velocity of a sneeze
3. Distribution of people across Earth's surface

Let's write some Python code to estimate this effect:

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
population = 7.9e9
avg_sneeze_mass = 0.5e-3  # kg
avg_sneeze_velocity = 10  # m/s
earth_mass = 5.97e24  # kg
earth_radius = 6.37e6  # m

# Calculate total momentum from sneezes
total_momentum = population * avg_sneeze_mass * avg_sneeze_velocity

# Assume sneezes are distributed evenly, so effective radius is R/sqrt(2)
effective_radius = earth_radius / np.sqrt(2)

# Calculate angular momentum change
delta_L = total_momentum * effective_radius

# Calculate Earth's moment of inertia
I_earth = 0.4 * earth_mass * earth_radius**2

# Calculate change in angular velocity
delta_omega = delta_L / I_earth

# Calculate change in day length
day_length = 24 * 3600  # seconds
delta_t = (delta_omega / (2 * np.pi)) * day_length**2

print(f"Change in day length: {delta_t*1e6:.2f} microseconds")
```

This silly example demonstrates how even seemingly large collective actions have minimal impact on Earth's rotation due to its enormous mass and angular momentum.
