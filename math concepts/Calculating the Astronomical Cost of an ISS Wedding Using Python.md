## Calculating the Astronomical Cost of an ISS Wedding Using Python
Slide 1: The ISS Wedding Challenge

This slide introduces the unique problem of estimating the cost of hosting a 200-person wedding aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It outlines the key elements of the wedding, including the ceremony, reception, catering, entertainment, and guest accommodations. The slide emphasizes the complexity of the task and the need for a systematic approach to calculate the total cost.

Slide 2: Space Wedding Logistics

This slide provides background information on the ISS and the challenges of hosting a large-scale event in space. It discusses the station's limited capacity, the need for specialized equipment and supplies, and the complexities of transportation to and from the ISS. The slide also touches on the environmental control systems required to support 200 guests in a closed space environment.

Slide 3: Assumptions and Constraints

Here, we outline the key assumptions made to simplify our cost estimation:

1. All necessary modifications to the ISS can be made to accommodate the event
2. Space tourism technology has advanced to allow for large-scale civilian space travel
3. All vendors and staff are willing to work in space conditions
4. Costs are based on current space industry rates, adjusted for inflation and the unique nature of the event
5. All equipment and supplies can be safely transported to the ISS
6. The event duration is set at 48 hours, including arrival and departure

Slide 4: Cost Breakdown Structure

This slide presents a mathematical formulation of the problem, breaking down the total cost into major categories:

Total Cost = Transportation Costs + Venue Modification Costs + Catering Costs + Entertainment Costs + Staffing Costs + Equipment and Supplies Costs + Miscellaneous Costs

Each category is further divided into subcategories, creating a comprehensive cost structure for the space wedding.

Slide 5: Estimation Methodology

This slide outlines the logical reasoning and pseudocode for our cost estimation approach:

```
function estimate_space_wedding_cost():
    transportation_cost = calculate_launch_costs(guests, staff, supplies)
    venue_modification_cost = estimate_iss_modifications()
    catering_cost = calculate_food_and_beverage_costs(menu, guests)
    entertainment_cost = sum(dj_cost, photographer_cost, videographer_cost)
    staffing_cost = calculate_staff_costs(space_crew, vendors, wedding_planner)
    equipment_cost = sum(rental_costs, specialized_equipment_costs)
    miscellaneous_cost = estimate_additional_expenses()
    
    total_cost = sum(all_individual_costs)
    
    return total_cost
```

Slide 6: Python Implementation - Part 1

```python
import math

def calculate_launch_costs(num_guests, num_staff, supplies_weight):
    cost_per_kg = 20000  # Estimated cost per kg to launch to ISS
    avg_person_weight = 75  # Average weight in kg
    total_weight = (num_guests + num_staff) * avg_person_weight + supplies_weight
    num_launches = math.ceil(total_weight / 20000)  # Assuming 20 tons per launch
    return num_launches * 200000000  # Estimated cost per launch

def estimate_iss_modifications():
    return 5000000000  # Rough estimate for major ISS modifications

def calculate_food_and_beverage_costs(num_guests):
    cost_per_person = 1000  # Higher due to space constraints
    return num_guests * cost_per_person
```

Slide 7: Python Implementation - Part 2

```python
def calculate_staff_costs(num_space_crew, num_vendors, wedding_planner_fee):
    space_crew_cost = num_space_crew * 1000000  # High cost for specialized space crew
    vendor_cost = num_vendors * 100000  # Including space training
    return space_crew_cost + vendor_cost + wedding_planner_fee

def estimate_space_wedding_cost():
    transportation = calculate_launch_costs(200, 50, 10000)
    venue = estimate_iss_modifications()
    catering = calculate_food_and_beverage_costs(200)
    entertainment = 500000  # DJ, photographers, videographers
    staffing = calculate_staff_costs(20, 30, 1000000)
    equipment = 100000000  # Specialized space equipment
    miscellaneous = 50000000  # Including attire, decor, etc.
    
    total_cost = sum([transportation, venue, catering, entertainment, 
                      staffing, equipment, miscellaneous])
    return total_cost

print(f"Estimated cost: ${estimate_space_wedding_cost():,}")
```

Slide 8: Real-World Applications

This slide discusses how the problem-solving approach and estimation techniques used for the space wedding can be applied to other complex scenarios:

1. Large-scale event planning in extreme environments (e.g., underwater or in remote locations)
2. Cost estimation for future space tourism ventures
3. Logistics planning for long-duration space missions or planetary colonization
4. Risk assessment and mitigation for high-stakes projects with multiple variables
5. Resource allocation for complex engineering projects with tight constraints

Slide 9: Space Wedding Trivia

Q: If the ISS wedding cake needed to be baked in space, how many astronaut-hours would it take to mix, bake, and decorate a 5-tier cake in microgravity?

This question introduces a lighthearted element while exploring the challenges of food preparation in space. Factors to consider include:

* Ingredient behavior in microgravity
* Modified baking techniques for space ovens
* Challenges of cake assembly and decoration without gravity

Slide 10: Space Cake Baking Simulation

```python
import random

def space_cake_baking_simulation():
    mixing_time = random.uniform(2, 4)  # Hours
    baking_time = random.uniform(3, 5)  # Hours
    cooling_time = random.uniform(1, 2)  # Hours
    decorating_time = random.uniform(4, 8)  # Hours
    
    total_time = mixing_time + baking_time + cooling_time + decorating_time
    astronauts_needed = random.randint(2, 4)
    
    return total_time * astronauts_needed

trials = 1000
total_astronaut_hours = sum(space_cake_baking_simulation() for _ in range(trials))
average_hours = total_astronaut_hours / trials

print(f"On average, it would take {average_hours:.2f} astronaut-hours to bake and decorate the space wedding cake.")
```
