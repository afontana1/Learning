## Mastering Big O Notation! Efficient Algorithms Demystified
Slide 1: Introduction to Big O Notation

Big O Notation is a fundamental concept in computer science used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It specifically characterizes the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's time complexity as the input size grows. Understanding Big O Notation is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance. This notation allows developers to make informed decisions about algorithm selection and implementation, especially when dealing with large-scale data processing or time-critical applications.

```python
def demonstrate_big_o():
    # O(1) - Constant time
    def constant_time(n):
        return 1
    
    # O(n) - Linear time
    def linear_time(n):
        return sum(range(n))
    
    # O(n^2) - Quadratic time
    def quadratic_time(n):
        return sum(i*j for i in range(n) for j in range(n))
    
    # Example usage
    n = 1000
    print(f"O(1): {constant_time(n)}")
    print(f"O(n): {linear_time(n)}")
    print(f"O(n^2): {quadratic_time(n)}")

demonstrate_big_o()
```

Slide 2: O(1) - Constant Time

Constant time complexity, denoted as O(1), represents algorithms whose execution time remains constant regardless of the input size. These operations are highly efficient and desirable in performance-critical scenarios. Common examples include accessing an array element by index, inserting or deleting an element in a hash table, or performing basic arithmetic operations.

```python
def constant_time_examples():
    # Accessing an array element by index
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    element = array[2]  # O(1)
    
    # Inserting an element into a set
    number_set = set([1, 2, 3])
    number_set.add(4)  # O(1)
    
    # Basic arithmetic operation
    result = 10 + 5  # O(1)
    
    return element, number_set, result

print(constant_time_examples())
```

Slide 3: O(n) - Linear Time

Linear time complexity, represented as O(n), describes algorithms whose execution time grows linearly with the input size. These algorithms process each element in the input exactly once. Common examples include finding the maximum or minimum value in an unsorted array, or performing a linear search.

```python
def linear_time_examples(arr):
    # Finding the maximum value in an unsorted array
    max_value = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_value:
            max_value = num
    
    # Linear search
    target = 42
    found = False
    for num in arr:
        if num == target:
            found = True
            break
    
    return max_value, found

sample_array = [3, 7, 1, 9, 4, 2, 8, 5, 6]
print(linear_time_examples(sample_array))
```

Slide 4: O(log n) - Logarithmic Time

Logarithmic time complexity, denoted as O(log n), represents algorithms whose execution time grows logarithmically with the input size. These algorithms are highly efficient, especially for large inputs. Common examples include binary search on a sorted array and operations on balanced binary search trees.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1  # Target not found

sorted_array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]
target = 11
result = binary_search(sorted_array, target)
print(f"Target {target} found at index: {result}")
```

Slide 5: O(n^2) - Quadratic Time

Quadratic time complexity, represented as O(n^2), describes algorithms whose execution time grows quadratically with the input size. These algorithms are less efficient for large inputs and often involve nested iterations over the input. Common examples include simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

unsorted_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_array = bubble_sort(unsorted_array.copy())
print(f"Original array: {unsorted_array}")
print(f"Sorted array: {sorted_array}")
```

Slide 6: O(n^3) - Cubic Time

Cubic time complexity, denoted as O(n^3), represents algorithms whose execution time grows cubically with the input size. These algorithms are generally inefficient for large inputs and often involve triple nested loops. A common example is the naive algorithm for multiplying two dense matrices.

```python
def naive_matrix_multiplication(A, B):
    n = len(A)
    C = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    
    return C

A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
result = naive_matrix_multiplication(A, B)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

Slide 7: O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time

Linearithmic time complexity, represented as O(n log n), describes algorithms that combine linear and logarithmic growth. These algorithms are more efficient than quadratic algorithms for large inputs. Common examples include efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

unsorted_array = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_array = merge_sort(unsorted_array)
print(f"Original array: {unsorted_array}")
print(f"Sorted array: {sorted_array}")
```

Slide 8: O(2^n) - Exponential Time

Exponential time complexity, denoted as O(2^n), represents algorithms whose execution time doubles with each additional input element. These algorithms are typically inefficient for large inputs and are often associated with recursive algorithms that solve problems by dividing them into multiple subproblems.

```python
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

def demonstrate_exponential_growth():
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"Fibonacci({i}) = {fibonacci_recursive(i)}")

demonstrate_exponential_growth()
```

Slide 9: O(n!) - Factorial Time

Factorial time complexity, represented as O(n!), describes algorithms whose execution time grows factorially with the input size. These algorithms are extremely inefficient for large inputs and are often associated with problems that involve generating all possible permutations or combinations of a set.

```python
def generate_permutations(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        yield arr
    else:
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            for perm in generate_permutations(arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]):
                yield [arr[i]] + perm

def demonstrate_factorial_growth():
    elements = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    permutations = list(generate_permutations(elements))
    print(f"Number of permutations for {elements}: {len(permutations)}")
    print("First few permutations:")
    for perm in permutations[:5]:
        print(perm)

demonstrate_factorial_growth()
```

Slide 10: O(sqrt(n)) - Square Root Time

Square root time complexity, denoted as O(sqrt(n)), represents algorithms whose execution time grows in proportion to the square root of the input size. These algorithms are more efficient than linear time algorithms for large inputs but less efficient than logarithmic time algorithms. A common example is the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit.

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    primes = [True] * (n + 1)
    primes[0] = primes[1] = False
    
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if primes[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                primes[j] = False
    
    return [num for num in range(2, n+1) if primes[num]]

limit = 50
prime_numbers = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
print(f"Prime numbers up to {limit}: {prime_numbers}")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example - Web Scraping

Consider a web scraping application that needs to extract information from a large number of web pages. The choice of algorithm and data structure can significantly impact the performance of this task.

```python
import time

def simulate_web_scraping(urls):
    # O(n) - Linear time complexity
    start_time = time.time()
    scraped_data = []
    for url in urls:
        # Simulate scraping a single page
        scraped_data.append(f"Data from {url}")
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Linear scraping time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

    # O(1) - Constant time complexity for data access
    start_time = time.time()
    data_dict = {url: f"Data from {url}" for url in urls}
    random_url = urls[len(urls) // 2]
    accessed_data = data_dict[random_url]
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Constant time data access: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# Simulate a list of 10,000 URLs
urls = [f"http://example.com/page{i}" for i in range(10000)]
simulate_web_scraping(urls)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example - Social Network Analysis

In social network analysis, graph algorithms are commonly used to analyze relationships between users. The choice of algorithm can significantly impact the performance of these analyses, especially for large networks.

```python
import random

def create_social_network(num_users):
    return {i: set(random.sample(range(num_users), min(50, num_users-1))) for i in range(num_users)}

def find_mutual_friends_naive(network, user1, user2):
    # O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of friends
    return network[user1].intersection(network[user2])

def find_mutual_friends_optimized(network, user1, user2):
    # O(min(len(network[user1]), len(network[user2]))) time complexity
    if len(network[user1]) > len(network[user2]):
        user1, user2 = user2, user1
    return set(friend for friend in network[user1] if friend in network[user2])

# Create a social network with 10,000 users
network = create_social_network(10000)

user1, user2 = 0, 1
print(f"Mutual friends (naive): {find_mutual_friends_naive(network, user1, user2)}")
print(f"Mutual friends (optimized): {find_mutual_friends_optimized(network, user1, user2)}")
```

Slide 13: Comparing Time Complexities

To better understand the practical implications of different time complexities, let's compare the execution times of algorithms with various Big O notations for different input sizes.

```python
import time
import math

def compare_time_complexities(n):
    def o_1():
        return 1
    
    def o_log_n():
        return sum(1 for _ in range(int(math.log2(n))))
    
    def o_n():
        return sum(1 for _ in range(n))
    
    def o_n_log_n():
        return sum(1 for _ in range(n) for _ in range(int(math.log2(n))))
    
    def o_n_squared():
        return sum(1 for _ in range(n) for _ in range(n))
    
    algorithms = [
        ("O(1)", o_1),
        ("O(log n)", o_log_n),
        ("O(n)", o_n),
        ("O(n log n)", o_n_log_n),
        ("O(n^2)", o_n_squared)
    ]
    
    results = {}
    for name, func in algorithms:
        start_time = time.time()
        func()
        end_time = time.time()
        results[name] = end_time - start_time
    
    return results

n = 10000
comparison = compare_time_complexities(n)
for name, duration in comparison.items():
    print(f"{name}: {duration:.6f} seconds")
```
