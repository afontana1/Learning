## Introduction to Boolean Algebra with Python

Slide 1: 

Introduction to Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is a mathematical system that deals with binary values, True and False, or 1 and 0. It provides a set of rules and operations used in computer programming, digital electronics, and other fields. In Python, we can leverage boolean algebra to perform logical operations and control the flow of our programs.

Slide 2: 

Boolean Values in Python

In Python, boolean values are represented by the keywords `True` and `False`. These values are capitalized and do not require quotes. Any value can be evaluated as either True or False based on its truthiness.

```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
```

Slide 3: 

Truthiness in Python

In Python, any value can be evaluated as True or False based on its truthiness. Values like `0`, `0.0`, `None`, `False`, empty strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are considered False. All other values are considered True.

```python
print(bool(42))       # True
print(bool(0))        # False
print(bool("hello"))  # True
print(bool(""))       # False
```

Slide 4: 

Boolean Operators

Python provides three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. These operators allow us to combine and manipulate boolean values.

```python
x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # False
print(x or y)   # True
print(not x)    # False
```

Slide 5: 

The `and` Operator

The `and` operator returns `True` if both operands are `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. It is commonly used to check if multiple conditions are met simultaneously.

```python
age = 25
income = 50000

if age >= 18 and income >= 40000:
    print("Eligible for loan")
else:
    print("Not eligible for loan")
```

Slide 6: 

The `or` Operator

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`. It is often used to check if at least one condition is met.

```python
username = "john_doe"
password = "weak_password"

if len(username) < 6 or len(password) < 8:
    print("Username or password is too short")
else:
    print("Valid credentials")
```

Slide 7: 

The `not` Operator

The `not` operator negates the boolean value of its operand. If the operand is `True`, it returns `False`, and if the operand is `False`, it returns `True`.

```python
is_student = True
is_employee = False

if not is_student and not is_employee:
    print("Please provide your status")
else:
    print("Status confirmed")
```

Slide 8: 

Short-Circuit Evaluation

Python evaluates boolean expressions using short-circuit evaluation. This means that the evaluation stops as soon as the final result can be determined. This can lead to more efficient code and can prevent unnecessary evaluations.

```python
x = 5
y = 0

if x > 0 and y / x > 1:  # No division by zero error
    print("Both conditions are True")
else:
    print("At least one condition is False")
```

Slide 9: 
 
Boolean Expressions in Conditions

Boolean expressions are commonly used in conditional statements like `if`, `while`, and `for` loops to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

```python
num = 7

if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is even")
else:
    print(f"{num} is odd")
```

Slide 10: 

Boolean Expressions in List Comprehensions

Boolean expressions can also be used in list comprehensions to filter or transform elements based on certain conditions.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Slide 11: 

Boolean Expressions in Conditional Expressions

Python's conditional expressions (also known as ternary operators) provide a concise way to evaluate boolean expressions and assign values based on their result.

```python
age = 18
is_adult = "Yes" if age >= 18 else "No"
print(is_adult)  # "Yes"
```

Slide 12: 

Combining Boolean Expressions

Boolean expressions can be combined using logical operators to create more complex conditions. This allows for powerful and flexible control over program execution.

```python
score = 85
grade = "A" if score >= 90 else "B" if score >= 80 else "C" if score >= 70 else "D"
print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")  # "Your grade is: B"
```

Slide 13: 

Boolean Algebra Laws

Boolean algebra follows certain laws and properties, such as the commutative, associative, distributive, and other properties. Understanding these laws can help you write more efficient and optimized code.

```python
x = True
y = False
z = True

# Commutative property
print(x and y == y and x)   # True
print(x or y == y or x)     # True

# Associative property
print((x and y) and z == x and (y and z))  # True
print((x or y) or z == x or (y or z))      # True
```

Slide 14: 

Boolean Algebra in Real-World Applications

Boolean algebra is widely used in various real-world applications, such as digital electronics, computer programming, database management, and more. Understanding boolean algebra can help you write better code, optimize algorithms, and solve complex problems more effectively.

```python
# Database query with boolean expressions
users = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "is_student": True},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "is_student": False},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 20, "is_student": True}
]

students = [user for user in users if user["is_student"] and user["age"] < 25]
print(students)  # [{'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 20, 'is_student': True}]
```
