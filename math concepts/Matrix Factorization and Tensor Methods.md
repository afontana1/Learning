## Matrix Factorization and Tensor Methods

Slide 1: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

NMF is a powerful technique for decomposing a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices W and H, such that V â‰ˆ WH. This method is widely used in dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and pattern recognition.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Generate a random nonnegative matrix
V = np.abs(np.random.randn(10, 5))

# Initialize NMF model
model = NMF(n_components=3, init='random', random_state=0)

# Fit the model and transform V
W = model.fit_transform(V)
H = model.components_

# Reconstruct the original matrix
V_approx = np.dot(W, H)

print("Original matrix shape:", V.shape)
print("W matrix shape:", W.shape)
print("H matrix shape:", H.shape)
print("Reconstructed matrix shape:", V_approx.shape)
```

Slide 2: NMF Real-Life Example: Image Decomposition

NMF can be used to decompose images into basic components, which is useful in facial recognition and image processing.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_olivetti_faces

# Load Olivetti faces dataset
faces = fetch_olivetti_faces().data
n_samples, n_features = faces.shape

# Apply NMF
n_components = 10
model = NMF(n_components=n_components, init='random', random_state=0)
W = model.fit_transform(faces)
H = model.components_

# Plot original and reconstructed faces
fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 5, figsize=(12, 8))
for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flatten()):
    if i < n_components:
        ax.imshow(H[i].reshape(64, 64), cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        ax.set_title(f'Component {i+1}')
    elif i < 2 * n_components:
        ax.imshow(faces[i-n_components].reshape(64, 64), cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        ax.set_title(f'Original {i-n_components+1}')
    else:
        reconstructed = np.dot(W[i-2*n_components], H)
        ax.imshow(reconstructed.reshape(64, 64), cmap=plt.cm.gray)
        ax.set_title(f'Reconstructed {i-2*n_components+1}')
    ax.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Tensor Methods

Tensor methods extend matrix operations to higher-dimensional arrays, allowing for more complex data analysis and representation. These methods are crucial in fields such as signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

```python
import tensorly as tl
from tensorly.decomposition import parafac

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = np.random.rand(4, 5, 3)

# Perform CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition
rank = 2
factors = parafac(tensor, rank=rank)

# Reconstruct the tensor
reconstructed_tensor = tl.kruskal_to_tensor(factors)

print("Original tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Reconstructed tensor shape:", reconstructed_tensor.shape)
print("Reconstruction error:", np.linalg.norm(tensor - reconstructed_tensor))
```

Slide 4: Tensor Methods: Tucker Decomposition

Tucker decomposition is another popular tensor factorization method, generalizing SVD to higher-order tensors.

```python
import tensorly as tl
from tensorly.decomposition import tucker

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = np.random.rand(4, 5, 3)

# Perform Tucker decomposition
core, factors = tucker(tensor, ranks=[2, 2, 2])

# Reconstruct the tensor
reconstructed_tensor = tl.tucker_to_tensor((core, factors))

print("Original tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Core tensor shape:", core.shape)
print("Factor matrices shapes:", [f.shape for f in factors])
print("Reconstruction error:", np.linalg.norm(tensor - reconstructed_tensor))
```

Slide 5: Sparse Recovery

Sparse recovery aims to reconstruct sparse signals from a small number of linear measurements. This technique is fundamental in compressed sensing and signal processing.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

# Generate a sparse signal
n = 1000
k = 10
x = np.zeros(n)
x[np.random.choice(n, k, replace=False)] = np.random.randn(k)

# Create measurement matrix
m = 100
A = np.random.randn(m, n)

# Generate measurements
y = np.dot(A, x)

# Solve using Lasso (L1-regularized least squares)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
x_recovered = lasso.fit(A, y).coef_

print("Original signal sparsity:", np.sum(x != 0))
print("Recovered signal sparsity:", np.sum(x_recovered != 0))
print("Recovery error:", np.linalg.norm(x - x_recovered) / np.linalg.norm(x))
```

Slide 6: Sparse Recovery: Orthogonal Matching Pursuit

Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is a greedy algorithm for sparse recovery, often used in compressed sensing applications.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import OrthogonalMatchingPursuit

# Generate a sparse signal
n = 1000
k = 10
x = np.zeros(n)
x[np.random.choice(n, k, replace=False)] = np.random.randn(k)

# Create measurement matrix
m = 100
A = np.random.randn(m, n)

# Generate measurements
y = np.dot(A, x)

# Solve using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
omp = OrthogonalMatchingPursuit(n_nonzero_coefs=k)
x_recovered = omp.fit(A, y).coef_

print("Original signal sparsity:", np.sum(x != 0))
print("Recovered signal sparsity:", np.sum(x_recovered != 0))
print("Recovery error:", np.linalg.norm(x - x_recovered) / np.linalg.norm(x))
```

Slide 7: Dictionary Learning

Dictionary learning involves finding a sparse representation of input data in terms of a learned dictionary. This technique is useful in image processing, feature extraction, and compression.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import DictionaryLearning
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate random patches
n_samples, n_features = 1000, 64
data = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features)

# Learn the dictionary
n_components = 100
dl = DictionaryLearning(n_components=n_components, alpha=1, max_iter=1000)
dictionary = dl.fit(data).components_

# Plot some dictionary atoms
fig, axes = plt.subplots(10, 10, figsize=(8, 8))
for i, ax in enumerate(axes.flat):
    ax.imshow(dictionary[i].reshape(8, 8), cmap='gray')
    ax.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Dictionary Learning: Image Denoising

Dictionary learning can be applied to image denoising by learning a dictionary from clean image patches and using it to reconstruct noisy images.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.image import extract_patches_2d
from sklearn.decomposition import DictionaryLearning
from skimage import data, util
from skimage.restoration import denoise_dictionary_learning
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and add noise to the image
image = util.img_as_float(data.camera())
noisy = image + 0.1 * np.random.randn(*image.shape)

# Extract patches and learn dictionary
patch_size = (8, 8)
patches = extract_patches_2d(noisy, patch_size)
dico = DictionaryLearning(n_components=100, alpha=1, max_iter=1000)
V = dico.fit(patches.reshape(len(patches), -1)).components_

# Denoise the image
denoised = denoise_dictionary_learning(noisy, dictionary=V.reshape((100, 8, 8)),
                                       patch_size=patch_size, alpha=0.1)

# Plot results
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
axes[0].imshow(image, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Original')
axes[1].imshow(noisy, cmap='gray')
axes[1].set_title('Noisy')
axes[2].imshow(denoised, cmap='gray')
axes[2].set_title('Denoised')
for ax in axes:
    ax.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Gaussian Mixture Models are probabilistic models that assume data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions. They are widely used for clustering and density estimation.

```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
n_samples = 300
X = np.concatenate([
    np.random.normal(0, 1, (n_samples, 2)),
    np.random.normal(3, 1.5, (n_samples, 2)),
    np.random.normal(-2, 1, (n_samples, 2))
])

# Fit Gaussian Mixture Model
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=3, random_state=0)
gmm.fit(X)

# Plot results
x = np.linspace(-6, 6, 200)
y = np.linspace(-6, 6, 200)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
XX = np.array([X.ravel(), Y.ravel()]).T
Z = -gmm.score_samples(XX)
Z = Z.reshape(X.shape)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.contourf(X, Y, Z, levels=20, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c='white', s=10, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Gaussian Mixture Model')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.colorbar(label='Negative log-likelihood')
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Gaussian Mixture Models: Speaker Identification

GMMs can be used for speaker identification by modeling the distribution of acoustic features extracted from speech signals.

```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
from scipy.io import wavfile
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated function to extract MFCC features from audio
def extract_mfcc(audio, n_mfcc=13):
    return np.random.randn(len(audio) // 1000, n_mfcc)

# Simulated function to load audio file
def load_audio(filename):
    return np.random.randn(44100 * 5)  # 5 seconds of audio at 44.1kHz

# Load and extract features from training data
speakers = ['speaker1', 'speaker2', 'speaker3']
models = {}

for speaker in speakers:
    audio = load_audio(f'{speaker}.wav')
    mfcc = extract_mfcc(audio)
    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=16, covariance_type='diag')
    models[speaker] = gmm.fit(mfcc)

# Test on new audio
test_audio = load_audio('test.wav')
test_mfcc = extract_mfcc(test_audio)

# Compute log-likelihood for each speaker
scores = {speaker: model.score(test_mfcc) for speaker, model in models.items()}

# Identify the speaker
identified_speaker = max(scores, key=scores.get)

print(f"Identified speaker: {identified_speaker}")
print("Log-likelihoods:")
for speaker, score in scores.items():
    print(f"{speaker}: {score}")
```

Slide 11: Matrix Completion

Matrix completion is the task of filling in missing entries of a partially observed matrix. It has applications in recommender systems, image inpainting, and collaborative filtering.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Create a matrix with missing values
n, m = 10, 8
true_rank = 3
U = np.random.randn(n, true_rank)
V = np.random.randn(true_rank, m)
X = np.dot(U, V)

# Randomly mask some entries
mask = np.random.rand(n, m) < 0.3
X_incomplete = np.where(mask, np.nan, X)

# Perform matrix completion using simple mean imputation
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X_completed = imputer.fit_transform(X_incomplete)

# Compute error
mse = np.mean((X - X_completed)**2)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Visualize results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
ax1.imshow(X, cmap='viridis')
ax1.set_title('Original Matrix')
ax2.imshow(X_incomplete, cmap='viridis')
ax2.set_title('Incomplete Matrix')
ax3.imshow(X_completed, cmap='viridis')
ax3.set_title('Completed Matrix')
plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Matrix Completion: Collaborative Filtering

Matrix completion is commonly used in collaborative filtering for recommender systems, such as movie rating prediction.

```python
from scipy.sparse.linalg import svds

# Create a user-item rating matrix with missing values
n_users, n_items = 100, 50
true_rank = 5
U = np.random.randn(n_users, true_rank)
V = np.random.randn(true_rank, n_items)
R = np.dot(U, V)

# Add some noise and mask random entries
R += 0.1 * np.random.randn(n_users, n_items)
mask = np.random.rand(n_users, n_items) < 0.8
R_observed = np.where(mask, R, 0)

# Perform matrix completion using SVD
U, s, Vt = svds(R_observed, k=true_rank)
S = np.diag(s)
R_completed = np.dot(np.dot(U, S), Vt)

# Compute error on observed entries
mse = np.mean((R[mask] - R_completed[mask])**2)
print(f"Mean Squared Error on observed entries: {mse}")

# Visualize results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
ax1.imshow(R, cmap='viridis')
ax1.set_title('True Ratings')
ax2.imshow(R_observed, cmap='viridis')
ax2.set_title('Observed Ratings')
ax3.imshow(R_completed, cmap='viridis')
ax3.set_title('Predicted Ratings')
plt.show()
```
