## Introduction to Fuzzy Logic in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Fuzzy Logic

Fuzzy Logic is a computational approach that deals with approximate reasoning and imprecise information. It allows for degrees of truth or membership, unlike traditional binary logic where a statement is either true or false. Fuzzy Logic is particularly useful in scenarios where information is incomplete, ambiguous, or imprecise, making it a powerful tool for decision-making and control systems.

Slide 2: Fuzzy Sets and Membership Functions

In Fuzzy Logic, the fundamental concept is the fuzzy set. A fuzzy set is a set where elements can have varying degrees of membership, represented by a membership function. The membership function maps each element to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the degree to which the element belongs to the set. This is in contrast to classical sets, where an element either belongs to the set (membership value of 1) or does not (membership value of 0).

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a fuzzy set for temperature
temperature = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
cold = np.fmax(0, (20 - temperature) / 20)
hot = np.fmax(0, (temperature - 80) / 20)

# Print the membership values for a few temperatures
print(f"Membership for 10°C: Cold = {cold[10]}, Hot = {hot[10]}")
print(f"Membership for 50°C: Cold = {cold[50]}, Hot = {hot[50]}")
print(f"Membership for 90°C: Cold = {cold[90]}, Hot = {hot[90]}")
```

Slide 3: Fuzzy Operations

Fuzzy sets support various operations similar to classical set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. However, these operations are defined differently in Fuzzy Logic, accounting for the varying degrees of membership. The union operation takes the maximum membership value, the intersection operation takes the minimum membership value, and the complement operation subtracts the membership value from 1.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define fuzzy sets
a = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0])
b = np.array([0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 0.6])

# Fuzzy union
c = np.fmax(a, b)
print("Fuzzy Union:", c)

# Fuzzy intersection
d = np.fmin(a, b)
print("Fuzzy Intersection:", d)

# Fuzzy complement
e = 1 - a
print("Fuzzy Complement:", e)
```

Slide 4: Fuzzy Rules and Inference Systems

Fuzzy Logic employs fuzzy rules and inference systems to make decisions or control processes based on fuzzy inputs and outputs. A fuzzy rule takes the form "IF (antecedent) THEN (consequent)," where both the antecedent and consequent are fuzzy statements. These rules are combined using an inference system, such as the Mamdani or Sugeno method, to produce a fuzzy output.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variables
temperature = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
cold = fuzz.membership.trimf(temperature, [0, 0, 20])
hot = fuzz.membership.trimf(temperature, [80, 100, 100])

# Define output variable
fan_speed = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
low = fuzz.membership.trimf(fan_speed, [0, 0, 5])
high = fuzz.membership.trimf(fan_speed, [5, 10, 10])

# Define fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmin(cold, low)  # IF cold THEN low fan speed
rule2 = np.fmin(hot, high)  # IF hot THEN high fan speed

# Aggregate rules
aggregated = np.fmax(rule1, rule2)

# Defuzzify output
fan_level = fuzz.defuzz(fan_speed, aggregated, 'centroid')
print(f"Fan speed should be: {fan_level}")
```

Slide 5: Fuzzification and Defuzzification

Fuzzification is the process of converting crisp input values into fuzzy sets, while defuzzification is the process of converting the fuzzy output sets into crisp values. Fuzzification involves mapping input values to their corresponding membership values in the defined fuzzy sets. Defuzzification utilizes methods like the centroid, mean of maximum, or smallest of maximum to derive a single output value from the aggregated fuzzy output.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input and output variables
distance = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
speed = np.arange(0, 101, 1)

# Fuzzify input
near = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [0, 0, 5])
far = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [5, 10, 10])

# Defuzzify output
slow = fuzz.membership.trimf(speed, [0, 0, 50])
fast = fuzz.membership.trimf(speed, [50, 100, 100])

# Apply fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmin(near, slow)
rule2 = np.fmin(far, fast)
aggregated = np.fmax(rule1, rule2)

# Defuzzify output
crisp_speed = fuzz.defuzz(speed, aggregated, 'centroid')
print(f"Recommended speed: {crisp_speed} km/h")
```

Slide 6: Fuzzy Logic Applications

Fuzzy Logic has found numerous applications across various domains due to its ability to handle imprecise or vague information. Some common applications include control systems (e.g., anti-lock braking systems, air conditioning systems), decision support systems, pattern recognition, data mining, and expert systems. Fuzzy Logic is particularly useful in situations where traditional binary logic fails to capture the complexity or ambiguity of real-world scenarios.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variables
temperature = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
humidity = np.arange(0, 101, 1)

# Define output variable
air_conditioning = np.arange(0, 11, 1)

# Fuzzify input variables
cool = fuzz.membership.trimf(temperature, [0, 0, 20])
warm = fuzz.membership.trimf(temperature, [15, 25, 35])
hot = fuzz.membership.trimf(temperature, [30, 40, 100])

dry = fuzz.membership.trimf(humidity, [0, 0, 40])
comfortable = fuzz.membership.trimf(humidity, [30, 50, 70])
humid = fuzz.membership.trimf(humidity, [60, 80, 100])

# Define output membership functions
low_ac = fuzz.membership.trimf(air_conditioning, [0, 0, 4])
medium_ac = fuzz.membership.trimf(air_conditioning, [2, 5, 8])
high_ac = fuzz.membership.trimf(air_conditioning, [6, 10, 10])

# Define fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmax(cool, dry)
rule2 = np.fmin(warm, comfortable)
rule3 = np.fmin(hot, humid)

# Defuzzify output
ac_level = fuzz.defuzz(air_conditioning, np.fmax(rule1, np.fmax(rule2, rule3)), 'centroid')
print(f"Air conditioning level: {ac_level}")
```

Slide 7: Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in Python

Python provides several libraries and toolboxes for working with Fuzzy Logic, making it easier to implement fuzzy systems and applications. One popular library is scikit-fuzzy, which offers a comprehensive set of functions and tools for building and analyzing fuzzy systems, including membership functions, fuzzy operations, and inference mechanisms.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variable
distance = np.arange(0, 11, 1)

# Define membership functions
near = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [0, 0, 5])
far = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [5, 10, 10])

# Visualize membership functions
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.plot(distance, near, 'r', linewidth=1.5, label='Near')
plt.plot(distance, far, 'b', linewidth=1.5, label='Far')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Distance Membership Functions')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Fuzzy Control System Example: Autonomous Braking

Let's consider an example of a fuzzy control system for an autonomous braking system in a self-driving car. The system takes input variables like the distance to the nearest obstacle and the relative speed, and outputs a braking force based on a set of fuzzy rules. This example demonstrates how Fuzzy Logic can be applied to real-world problems involving imprecise or vague inputs.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input and output variables
distance = np.arange(0, 51, 1)
speed = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
brake_force = np.arange(0, 101, 1)

# Define membership functions
close = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [0, 0, 10])
medium = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [5, 20, 35])
far = fuzz.membership.trimf(distance, [30, 50, 50])

slow = fuzz.membership.trimf(speed, [0, 0, 30])
moderate = fuzz.membership.trimf(speed, [20, 50, 80])
fast = fuzz.membership.trimf(speed, [70, 100, 100])

low_brake = fuzz.membership.trimf(brake_force, [0, 0, 30])
medium_brake = fuzz.membership.trimf(brake_force, [20, 50, 80])
high_brake = fuzz.membership.trimf(brake_force, [70, 100, 100])

# Define fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmin(close, fast)
rule2 = np.fmin(medium, moderate)
rule3 = np.fmin(far, slow)

# Defuzzify output
brake_level = fuzz.defuzz(brake_force, np.fmax(rule1, np.fmax(rule2, rule3)), 'centroid')
print(f"Recommended brake force: {brake_level}%")
```

Slide 9: Fuzzy Logic in Decision Support Systems

Fuzzy Logic can be applied to decision support systems, where it helps in handling uncertainties and ambiguities inherent in decision-making processes. By incorporating fuzzy rules and inference mechanisms, these systems can provide recommendations or suggestions based on imprecise or vague inputs, mimicking human-like reasoning.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variables
price = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
quality = np.arange(0, 101, 1)

# Define membership functions
low_price = fuzz.membership.trimf(price, [0, 0, 30])
medium_price = fuzz.membership.trimf(price, [20, 50, 80])
high_price = fuzz.membership.trimf(price, [70, 100, 100])

poor_quality = fuzz.membership.trimf(quality, [0, 0, 30])
average_quality = fuzz.membership.trimf(quality, [20, 50, 80])
excellent_quality = fuzz.membership.trimf(quality, [70, 100, 100])

# Define output variable
purchase_decision = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
not_recommended = fuzz.membership.trimf(purchase_decision, [0, 0, 3])
consider = fuzz.membership.trimf(purchase_decision, [2, 5, 8])
recommended = fuzz.membership.trimf(purchase_decision, [7, 10, 10])

# Define fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmin(low_price, excellent_quality)
rule2 = np.fmin(medium_price, average_quality)
rule3 = np.fmin(high_price, poor_quality)

# Defuzzify output
decision = fuzz.defuzz(purchase_decision, np.fmax(rule1, np.fmax(rule2, rule3)), 'centroid')
print(f"Purchase decision score: {decision}")
```

Slide 10: Fuzzy Logic in Image Processing

Fuzzy Logic techniques can be applied in various image processing tasks, such as image segmentation, edge detection, and noise reduction. By utilizing fuzzy membership functions and rules, images can be processed in a more flexible and adaptive manner, accounting for uncertainties and imprecision inherent in visual data.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz
import skimage.io
import skimage.filters

# Load an image
image = skimage.io.imread('example_image.jpg', as_gray=True)

# Define membership functions for edge detection
low_gradient = fuzz.membership.trimf(np.arange(0, 256, 1), [0, 0, 64])
medium_gradient = fuzz.membership.trimf(np.arange(0, 256, 1), [32, 128, 224])
high_gradient = fuzz.membership.trimf(np.arange(0, 256, 1), [192, 256, 256])

# Apply fuzzy edge detection
edges = skimage.filters.sobel(image)
fuzzy_edges = np.fmax(np.fmin(low_gradient, edges), np.fmin(medium_gradient, edges))

# Display the original and processed images
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original Image')
plt.axis('off')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(fuzzy_edges, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Fuzzy Edge Detection')
plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Fuzzy Logic in Pattern Recognition

Fuzzy Logic can be employed in pattern recognition tasks, where it helps in dealing with uncertainties and imprecision in the input data. By defining fuzzy membership functions and rules, patterns can be classified or recognized based on their degree of similarity to predefined fuzzy sets or models.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variables
feature1 = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
feature2 = np.arange(0, 11, 1)

# Define membership functions
low_f1 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature1, [0, 0, 4])
medium_f1 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature1, [2, 5, 8])
high_f1 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature1, [6, 10, 10])

low_f2 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature2, [0, 0, 4])
medium_f2 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature2, [2, 5, 8])
high_f2 = fuzz.membership.trimf(feature2, [6, 10, 10])

# Define fuzzy rules for pattern recognition
rule1 = np.fmin(low_f1, low_f2)  # Pattern 1
rule2 = np.fmin(medium_f1, medium_f2)  # Pattern 2
rule3 = np.fmin(high_f1, high_f2)  # Pattern 3

# Defuzzify output
pattern_match = np.zeros(len(feature1))
for i in range(len(feature1)):
    pattern_match[i] = max(rule1[i], rule2[i], rule3[i])

# Classify input pattern
threshold = 0.5
recognized_pattern = np.where(pattern_match >= threshold, 'Pattern Found', 'No Pattern')
print(recognized_pattern)
```

In this example, we define two input features (feature1 and feature2) and membership functions for low, medium, and high values of each feature. Fuzzy rules are then defined to represent three different patterns based on the combination of feature values. The input data is evaluated against these rules, and the degree of match for each pattern is calculated using the fuzzy operations. Finally, a threshold is applied to classify the input as either a recognized pattern or not.

Fuzzy Logic in pattern recognition allows for handling uncertainties and imprecision in the input data, which can be beneficial in scenarios where the patterns are not well-defined or have overlapping characteristics. By adjusting the membership functions and rules, the pattern recognition system can be fine-tuned to achieve better performance and adapt to specific problem domains.

Slide 12: Fuzzy Logic in Data Mining

Fuzzy Logic can be integrated into data mining techniques to handle imprecise or vague data, as well as to capture the inherent uncertainties in the data mining process itself. Fuzzy clustering, fuzzy association rules, and fuzzy decision trees are some examples of how Fuzzy Logic can be applied in data mining tasks.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=500, centers=3, n_features=2, random_state=42)

# Apply fuzzy c-means clustering
cntr, u, u0, d, jm, p, fpc = fuzz.cluster.cmeans(
    X.T, 3, 2, error=0.005, maxiter=1000, init=None, seed=42)

# Visualize the clustering results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=np.argmax(u, axis=0), s=50, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(cntr[:, 0], cntr[:, 1], s=100, c='r', marker='*')
plt.title('Fuzzy C-Means Clustering')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Fuzzy Logic in Expert Systems

Expert systems can benefit from the incorporation of Fuzzy Logic, allowing them to handle uncertainties and imprecision in the knowledge base and reasoning process. Fuzzy rules and inference mechanisms can be used to capture the expertise and decision-making strategies of human experts, enabling the expert system to provide more human-like and flexible recommendations or solutions.

Source Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Define input variables
experience = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
skills = np.arange(0, 11, 1)

# Define membership functions
low_exp = fuzz.membership.trimf(experience, [0, 0, 4])
medium_exp = fuzz.membership.trimf(experience, [2, 5, 8])
high_exp = fuzz.membership.trimf(experience, [6, 10, 10])

poor_skills = fuzz.membership.trimf(skills, [0, 0, 4])
average_skills = fuzz.membership.trimf(skills, [2, 5, 8])
excellent_skills = fuzz.membership.trimf(skills, [6, 10, 10])

# Define output variable
job_suitability = np.arange(0, 101, 1)
not_suitable = fuzz.membership.trimf(job_suitability, [0, 0, 30])
moderately_suitable = fuzz.membership.trimf(job_suitability, [20, 50, 80])
highly_suitable = fuzz.membership.trimf(job_suitability, [70, 100, 100])

# Define fuzzy rules
rule1 = np.fmin(low_exp, poor_skills)
rule2 = np.fmin(medium_exp, average_skills)
rule3 = np.fmin(high_exp, excellent_skills)

# Defuzzify output
suitability = fuzz.defuzz(job_suitability, np.fmax(rule1, np.fmax(rule2, rule3)), 'centroid')
print(f"Job suitability score: {suitability}%")
```
