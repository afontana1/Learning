## Understanding Data Distribution in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Data Distribution

Data distribution refers to the way data is spread or organized within a dataset. Understanding data distribution is crucial for effective data analysis, visualization, and modeling. In Python, several libraries and techniques are available to explore and analyze data distribution.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

Slide 2: Measures of Central Tendency

Central tendency measures help summarize the central or typical value in a dataset. These include mean, median, and mode.

Code:

```python
data = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
mean = sum(data) / len(data)
median = np.median(data)
mode = max(set(data), key=data.count)

print(f"Mean: {mean}\nMedian: {median}\nMode: {mode}")
```

Slide 3: Measures of Dispersion

Dispersion measures quantify the spread or variability of data around the central tendency. Common measures include range, variance, and standard deviation.

Code:

```python
data = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
data_range = max(data) - min(data)
variance = np.var(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(f"Range: {data_range}\nVariance: {variance}\nStandard Deviation: {std_dev}")
```

Slide 4: Visualizing Data Distribution

Visualization techniques like histograms, box plots, and violin plots can provide insights into data distribution.

Code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(data, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Histogram of Normal Distribution")
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Handling Outliers

Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data. Identifying and handling outliers is essential for accurate data analysis.

Code:

```python
import seaborn as sns

data = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.boxplot(x=data["total_bill"])
plt.title("Box Plot of Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Normality Tests

Normality tests help determine whether a dataset follows a normal distribution, which is often an assumption for many statistical analyses.

Code:

```python
from scipy.stats import normaltest

data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
stat, p-value = normaltest(data)

if p-value > 0.05:
    print("Data follows a normal distribution.")
else:
    print("Data does not follow a normal distribution.")
```

Slide 7: Data Transformation

Data transformation techniques, such as log or square root transformations, can help adjust for skewed distributions or unequal variances.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.random.exponential(2, 1000)
log_data = np.log(data)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.hist(data, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Original Data Distribution")
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.hist(log_data, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Log-transformed Data Distribution")
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Binning and Discretization

Binning and discretization techniques can be used to convert continuous data into discrete categories or bins, which can be useful for certain analyses or visualizations.

Code:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
bins = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
labels = ["Low", "Low-Med", "Med-Low", "Med", "Med-High", "High"]
discretized_data = pd.cut(data, bins=bins, labels=labels)

print(discretized_data.value_counts())
```

Slide 9: Kernel Density Estimation

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric technique for estimating the probability density function of a random variable.

Code:

```python
import seaborn as sns

data = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.kdeplot(data=data["total_bill"], shade=True)
plt.title("Kernel Density Estimate of Total Bill")
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether a sample data deviates significantly from a hypothesized distribution.

Code:

```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp

data = np.random.normal(3, 1, 100)
hypothesized_mean = 2.5
stat, p-value = ttest_1samp(data, hypothesized_mean)

if p-value < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The sample mean is significantly different from the hypothesized mean.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: The sample mean is not significantly different from the hypothesized mean.")
```

Slide 11: Statistical Modeling

Understanding data distribution is crucial for building accurate statistical models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or time series models.

Code:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

data = sm.datasets.longley.load_pandas().data
X = data[["Armed.Forces", "Employed", "GNP.deflator"]]
y = data["GDP"]

model = sm.OLS(y, sm.add_constant(X)).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

Slide 12: Sampling Techniques

Sampling techniques, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, or cluster sampling, can be used to obtain representative samples from a population for data analysis.

Code:

```python
import random

population = list(range(1, 101))
sample_size = 10
random_sample = random.sample(population, sample_size)

print("Random Sample:", random_sample)
```

Slide 13: Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a resampling technique used to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling from the original data with replacement.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.utils import resample

data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
bootstrap_means = []
for i in range(1000):
    bootstrap_sample = resample(data)
    bootstrap_means.append(np.mean(bootstrap_sample))

print("Bootstrap Mean:", np.mean(bootstrap_means))
print("Sample Mean:", np.mean(data))
```

Slide 14: Types of Data Distributions

Data can follow various distribution patterns, and understanding these patterns is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical techniques and models. Some common types of distributions include:

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Normal Distribution
normal_data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 10000)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
sns.distplot(normal_data, hist=False)
plt.title("Normal Distribution")

# Skewed Distribution
skewed_data = np.random.exponential(2, 10000)
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
sns.distplot(skewed_data, hist=False)
plt.title("Skewed Distribution")

# Bimodal Distribution
bimodal_data = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(-2, 1, 5000), np.random.normal(2, 1, 5000)])
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
sns.distplot(bimodal_data, hist=False)
plt.title("Bimodal Distribution")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This slide discusses and visualizes three common types of data distributions: normal, skewed, and bimodal. The code generates synthetic data following these distributions and plots their probability density functions using seaborn's distplot function.

Normal distributions are symmetric and bell-shaped, often used to model many natural phenomena. Skewed distributions are asymmetric, with a longer tail on one side, commonly seen in phenomena with a lower or upper bound. Bimodal distributions have two distinct peaks, indicating the presence of two underlying groups or processes.

Understanding the type of distribution your data follows is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical methods, transformations, and modeling techniques.
