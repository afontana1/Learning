## Levels of Measurement in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Levels of Measurement

Measurement levels are fundamental ways of categorizing different types of data based on their properties and the mathematical operations that can be performed on them. Understanding these levels helps in selecting appropriate statistical analyses and visualization methods.

```python
# Example showing different measurement levels
data_types = {
    'nominal': ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
    'ordinal': ['cold', 'warm', 'hot'],
    'interval': [10, 20, 30],  # Temperature in Celsius
    'ratio': [0, 50, 100]      # Distance in meters
}
```

Slide 2: Nominal Level

The nominal level is the most basic level of measurement. It represents categories with no inherent order. The only valid operation is determining if two values are equal or different.

```python
def analyze_nominal(categories):
    # Count frequency of each category
    freq = {}
    for cat in categories:
        freq[cat] = freq.get(cat, 0) + 1
    return freq

colors = ['red', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'blue']
print(analyze_nominal(colors))
```

Slide 3: Results for Nominal Level

```python
# Output of previous code
{'red': 2, 'blue': 2, 'green': 1}
```

Slide 4: Real-Life Example - Nominal Data

Consider a study of different types of trees in a forest. Each tree species is a nominal category, where no species is inherently "greater" than another.

```python
def classify_trees(observations):
    species = {}
    for tree in observations:
        species[tree] = species.get(tree, 0) + 1
    return f"Biodiversity index: {len(species)}"

trees = ['oak', 'pine', 'maple', 'oak', 'birch']
print(classify_trees(trees))
```

Slide 5: Ordinal Level

Ordinal data has categories that follow a natural order, but the intervals between values aren't necessarily equal. Common operations include comparison and ranking.

```python
def compare_ordinal(val1, val2, order_map):
    return "Greater" if order_map[val1] > order_map[val2] else "Lesser"

rankings = {'novice': 1, 'intermediate': 2, 'expert': 3}
print(compare_ordinal('expert', 'novice', rankings))
```

Slide 6: Real-Life Example - Ordinal Data

Educational achievement levels demonstrate ordinal measurement, where progression exists but intervals aren't uniform.

```python
def analyze_education_levels(students):
    levels = {'high_school': 1, 'bachelors': 2, 'masters': 3, 'doctorate': 4}
    return sorted(students, key=lambda x: levels[x])

education = ['masters', 'high_school', 'doctorate', 'bachelors']
print(analyze_education_levels(education))
```

Slide 7: Interval Level

Interval measurements have equal distances between values but no true zero point. Temperature in Celsius is a classic example.

```python
def convert_temperature(celsius_temps):
    # Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
    fahrenheit = [(temp * 9/5) + 32 for temp in celsius_temps]
    return fahrenheit

temps = [0, 10, 20, 30]
print(convert_temperature(temps))
```

Slide 8: Properties of Interval Data

In interval data, ratios between values are meaningless because there's no true zero. 20°C isn't "twice as hot" as 10°C.

```python
def demonstrate_interval_properties(temp1, temp2):
    ratio = temp1 / temp2  # This ratio is meaningless
    difference = temp1 - temp2  # This difference is meaningful
    return f"Difference: {difference}°C"

print(demonstrate_interval_properties(20, 10))
```

Slide 9: Ratio Level

Ratio measurements have equal intervals and a true zero point, making all arithmetic operations meaningful.

```python
def analyze_ratio_data(measurements):
    mean = sum(measurements) / len(measurements)
    ratio = max(measurements) / min(measurements)
    return f"Mean: {mean}, Max/Min ratio: {ratio}"

distances = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # meters
print(analyze_ratio_data(distances))
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example - Ratio Data

Consider measuring the height of plants in a garden experiment.

```python
def analyze_plant_growth(heights):
    initial_height = heights[0]
    growth_rate = [(h - initial_height) / initial_height * 100 
                   for h in heights[1:]]
    return f"Growth rates: {growth_rate}%"

weekly_heights = [5, 7, 10, 15]  # cm
print(analyze_plant_growth(weekly_heights))
```

Slide 11: Statistical Operations by Level

```python
def allowed_operations(data_level, data):
    operations = {
        'nominal': {'mode', 'frequency'},
        'ordinal': {'median', 'percentile', 'mode'},
        'interval': {'mean', 'standard_deviation'},
        'ratio': {'geometric_mean', 'coefficient_of_variation'}
    }
    return f"Allowed operations for {data_level}: {operations[data_level]}"

print(allowed_operations('ratio', [1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

Slide 12: Visualization Techniques

```python
def recommend_plot(measurement_level):
    plots = {
        'nominal': 'Bar chart, Pie chart',
        'ordinal': 'Bar chart, Box plot',
        'interval': 'Histogram, Line plot',
        'ratio': 'Scatter plot, Line plot'
    }
    return plots[measurement_level]

for level in ['nominal', 'ordinal', 'interval', 'ratio']:
    print(f"{level}: {recommend_plot(level)}")
```

Slide 13: Common Errors and Validation

```python
def validate_measurement_level(data, expected_level):
    validations = {
        'nominal': lambda x: isinstance(x, str),
        'ordinal': lambda x: x in ['low', 'medium', 'high'],
        'interval': lambda x: isinstance(x, (int, float)),
        'ratio': lambda x: isinstance(x, (int, float)) and x >= 0
    }
    return all(validations[expected_level](x) for x in data)
```
