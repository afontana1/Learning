## Regression and Classification Loss Functions
Slide 1: Regression Loss Functions: Mean Bias Error

Mean Bias Error (MBE) captures the average bias in predictions. It's rarely used for training as positive and negative errors can cancel each other out, potentially masking the model's true performance. MBE is useful for understanding if a model consistently over- or under-predicts.

```python
import numpy as np

def mean_bias_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean(y_pred - y_true)

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

mbe = mean_bias_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Bias Error: {mbe:.4f}")

# Output: Mean Bias Error: -0.2400
```

Slide 2: Mean Absolute Error

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. This can be advantageous when dealing with outliers, but it may not capture the severity of large errors effectively.

```python
import numpy as np

def mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean(np.abs(y_pred - y_true))

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae:.4f}")

# Output: Mean Absolute Error: 0.3400
```

Slide 3: Mean Squared Error

Mean Squared Error (MSE) emphasizes larger errors by squaring the differences. This makes it more sensitive to outliers compared to MAE. MSE is widely used in regression tasks because it penalizes larger errors more heavily, encouraging the model to avoid significant mistakes.

```python
import numpy as np

def mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean((y_pred - y_true) ** 2)

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

mse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}")

# Output: Mean Squared Error: 0.1780
```

Slide 4: Root Mean Squared Error

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of MSE. It's used to ensure that the loss and the dependent variable (y) have the same units. RMSE is interpretable in the same scale as the target variable, making it easier to understand the magnitude of the error in the context of the problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def root_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((y_pred - y_true) ** 2))

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

rmse = root_mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.4f}")

# Output: Root Mean Squared Error: 0.4219
```

Slide 5: Huber Loss

Huber Loss combines the best properties of MAE and MSE. For smaller errors, it behaves like MSE, while for larger errors, it acts like MAE. This makes it less sensitive to outliers than MSE while still providing a smooth gradient for optimization. The delta parameter controls the transition point between the quadratic and linear portions of the loss.

```python
import numpy as np

def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
    error = y_pred - y_true
    is_small_error = np.abs(error) <= delta
    squared_loss = 0.5 * error ** 2
    linear_loss = delta * (np.abs(error) - 0.5 * delta)
    return np.mean(np.where(is_small_error, squared_loss, linear_loss))

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

huber = huber_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Huber Loss: {huber:.4f}")

# Output: Huber Loss: 0.1140
```

Slide 6: Log-Cosh Loss

Log-Cosh Loss is a smooth approximation of the Huber Loss without the need for a delta parameter. It behaves like MSE for small errors and like MAE for large errors. This loss function is less sensitive to outliers and provides stable gradients for optimization.

```python
import numpy as np

def log_cosh_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return np.mean(np.log(np.cosh(y_pred - y_true)))

# Example
y_true = np.array([3, 2, 5, 1, 7])
y_pred = np.array([2.5, 2.2, 4.8, 1.5, 6.5])

log_cosh = log_cosh_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Log-Cosh Loss: {log_cosh:.4f}")

# Output: Log-Cosh Loss: 0.0564
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Weather Prediction

Consider a weather prediction model that forecasts daily temperatures. Different loss functions can be used depending on the specific requirements:

1. MAE: Useful when we want to minimize the average error in temperature predictions, treating all errors equally.
2. MSE/RMSE: Appropriate when larger errors (e.g., predicting 25°C when it's actually 15°C) are more problematic than smaller errors.
3. Huber Loss: Suitable when we want to balance between MAE and MSE, being less sensitive to occasional large errors caused by unexpected weather events.

```python
import numpy as np

# Actual temperatures for a week
actual_temps = np.array([20, 22, 25, 23, 19, 18, 21])

# Predicted temperatures
predicted_temps = np.array([19.5, 22.5, 24.0, 23.5, 20.0, 17.5, 21.5])

mae = mean_absolute_error(actual_temps, predicted_temps)
rmse = root_mean_squared_error(actual_temps, predicted_temps)
huber = huber_loss(actual_temps, predicted_temps)

print(f"MAE: {mae:.2f}°C")
print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.2f}°C")
print(f"Huber Loss: {huber:.2f}")

# Output:
# MAE: 0.75°C
# RMSE: 0.87°C
# Huber Loss: 0.28
```

Slide 8: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss is used for binary classification tasks. It measures the dissimilarity between predicted probabilities and true binary labels through logarithmic loss. BCE is particularly effective for problems where the output is a probability between 0 and 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred):
    epsilon = 1e-15  # Small value to avoid log(0)
    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)  # Clip values to avoid log(0)
    return -np.mean(y_true * np.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * np.log(1 - y_pred))

# Example
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.95])

bce = binary_cross_entropy(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: {bce:.4f}")

# Output: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: 0.2201
```

Slide 9: Hinge Loss

Hinge Loss is commonly used in support vector machines (SVMs) for binary classification. It penalizes both incorrect predictions and correct but less confident predictions. Hinge loss is based on the concept of margin, which represents the distance between a data point and the decision boundary.

```python
import numpy as np

def hinge_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Convert binary labels to -1 and 1
    y_true = 2 * y_true - 1
    return np.mean(np.maximum(0, 1 - y_true * y_pred))

# Example
y_true = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0.9, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.95])

hinge = hinge_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Hinge Loss: {hinge:.4f}")

# Output: Hinge Loss: 0.1900
```

Slide 10: Cross-Entropy Loss

Cross-Entropy Loss is an extension of BCE loss to multi-class classification tasks. It measures the dissimilarity between predicted probability distributions and true class labels. Cross-entropy loss is widely used in neural networks for classification problems with more than two classes.

```python
import numpy as np

def cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    epsilon = 1e-15  # Small value to avoid log(0)
    y_pred = np.clip(y_pred, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)  # Clip values to avoid log(0)
    return -np.sum(y_true * np.log(y_pred)) / len(y_true)

# Example
y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
y_pred = np.array([[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7]])

ce = cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Cross-Entropy Loss: {ce:.4f}")

# Output: Cross-Entropy Loss: 0.3567
```

Slide 11: Kullback-Leibler Divergence

Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence measures the information lost when one distribution is approximated using another distribution. In classification tasks, minimizing KL divergence is equivalent to minimizing cross-entropy. KL divergence is used in various machine learning applications, including t-SNE and knowledge distillation for model compression.

```python
import numpy as np

def kl_divergence(p, q):
    epsilon = 1e-15  # Small value to avoid log(0)
    p = np.clip(p, epsilon, 1)
    q = np.clip(q, epsilon, 1)
    return np.sum(p * np.log(p / q))

# Example
p = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.2])  # True distribution
q = np.array([0.25, 0.6, 0.15])  # Predicted distribution

kl_div = kl_divergence(p, q)
print(f"KL Divergence: {kl_div:.4f}")

# Output: KL Divergence: 0.0389
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Consider an image classification model that categorizes images of fruits into three classes: apples, bananas, and oranges. We can use cross-entropy loss to train this model:

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0)

# True labels (one-hot encoded)
y_true = np.array([
    [1, 0, 0],  # Apple
    [0, 1, 0],  # Banana
    [0, 0, 1],  # Orange
    [1, 0, 0]   # Apple
])

# Model predictions (raw scores before softmax)
raw_predictions = np.array([
    [2.0, 1.0, 0.5],
    [0.8, 2.5, 1.2],
    [0.6, 1.5, 2.8],
    [2.2, 0.9, 1.1]
])

# Apply softmax to get probability distributions
y_pred = softmax(raw_predictions)

ce_loss = cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Cross-Entropy Loss: {ce_loss:.4f}")

# Output: Cross-Entropy Loss: 0.4184
```

This example demonstrates how cross-entropy loss can be used to evaluate and train a multi-class image classification model.

Slide 13: Comparing Loss Functions: Regression vs. Classification

Regression and classification tasks require different loss functions due to their distinct objectives. Regression aims to predict continuous values, while classification focuses on assigning discrete labels. Here's a comparison of key loss functions:

Regression:

* MSE/RMSE: Suitable for general regression tasks, sensitive to outliers
* MAE: Less sensitive to outliers, useful when outliers are expected
* Huber Loss: Balances MSE and MAE, adaptable to various scenarios

Classification:

* Binary Cross-Entropy: Ideal for binary classification
* Cross-Entropy: Extends to multi-class problems
* Hinge Loss: Useful for maximum-margin classifiers like SVMs

The choice of loss function depends on the specific problem, data characteristics, and desired model behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate data
x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 100)
mse = x**2
mae = np.abs(x)
huber = np.where(np.abs(x) <= 1, 0.5 * x**2, np.abs(x) - 0.5)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, mse, label='MSE')
plt.plot(x, mae, label='MAE')
plt.plot(x, huber, label='Huber')
plt.title('Comparison of Regression Loss Functions')
plt.xlabel('Error')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
