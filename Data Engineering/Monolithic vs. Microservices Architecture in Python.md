## Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture in Python
Slide 1: Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture

Monolithic and microservices architectures represent two fundamentally different approaches to designing and building software applications. This presentation will explore the key differences between these architectures, their advantages and disadvantages, and provide practical Python examples to illustrate their implementation.

```python
# Visualization of Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

def create_architecture_graph(arch_type):
    G = nx.Graph()
    if arch_type == "Monolithic":
        G.add_node("Monolithic App")
        G.add_edges_from([("Monolithic App", "UI"),
                          ("Monolithic App", "Business Logic"),
                          ("Monolithic App", "Data Access")])
    else:
        G.add_nodes_from(["Service A", "Service B", "Service C"])
        G.add_edges_from([("API Gateway", "Service A"),
                          ("API Gateway", "Service B"),
                          ("API Gateway", "Service C")])
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', 
            node_size=3000, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')
    plt.title(f"{arch_type} Architecture")
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

create_architecture_graph("Monolithic")
create_architecture_graph("Microservices")
```

Slide 2: Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a traditional model where all components of an application are interconnected and interdependent. In this approach, the entire application is built as a single, indivisible unit. All functions are managed and served in one place, typically sharing the same database.

```python
# Simple Monolithic Flask Application
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Shared database (simulated with a dictionary)
database = {}

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    return jsonify(database.get('users', []))

@app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
    return jsonify(database.get('products', []))

@app.route('/orders', methods=['GET'])
def get_orders():
    return jsonify(database.get('orders', []))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Slide 3: Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is an approach where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. This architecture allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance of individual components.

```python
# Microservices Example: User Service
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# User service database (simulated)
user_db = {}

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    return jsonify(user_db)

@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>/orders', methods=['GET'])
def get_user_orders(user_id):
    # Call Order service to get user's orders
    order_service_url = "http://order-service/orders"
    response = requests.get(f"{order_service_url}?user_id={user_id}")
    return jsonify(response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5001)
```

Slide 4: Key Difference: Coupling

One of the primary differences between monolithic and microservices architectures is the level of coupling between components. Monolithic applications have tight coupling, where changes in one part can affect the entire system. Microservices, on the other hand, are loosely coupled, allowing for independent development and deployment of services.

```python
# Coupling Example

# Monolithic (Tightly Coupled)
class MonolithicApp:
    def process_order(self, order):
        if self.validate_order(order):
            self.update_inventory(order)
            self.charge_payment(order)
            self.send_confirmation(order)

    def validate_order(self, order):
        # Order validation logic
        pass

    def update_inventory(self, order):
        # Inventory update logic
        pass

    def charge_payment(self, order):
        # Payment processing logic
        pass

    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        # Confirmation email logic
        pass

# Microservices (Loosely Coupled)
class OrderService:
    def process_order(self, order):
        if self.validate_order(order):
            inventory_service.update_inventory(order)
            payment_service.charge_payment(order)
            notification_service.send_confirmation(order)

    def validate_order(self, order):
        # Order validation logic
        pass

class InventoryService:
    def update_inventory(self, order):
        # Inventory update logic
        pass

class PaymentService:
    def charge_payment(self, order):
        # Payment processing logic
        pass

class NotificationService:
    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        # Confirmation email logic
        pass
```

Slide 5: Scalability

Scalability is another crucial difference between the two architectures. Monolithic applications scale as a single unit, which can be inefficient and resource-intensive. Microservices allow for individual scaling of services based on demand, offering more flexibility and efficient resource utilization.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def plot_scalability():
    users = np.arange(1000, 10001, 1000)
    monolithic_resources = users * 1.5
    microservices_resources = users * 1.2

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(users, monolithic_resources, label='Monolithic', marker='o')
    plt.plot(users, microservices_resources, label='Microservices', marker='s')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Users')
    plt.ylabel('Resource Utilization')
    plt.title('Scalability: Monolithic vs Microservices')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

plot_scalability()
```

Slide 6: Development and Deployment

The development and deployment processes differ significantly between monolithic and microservices architectures. Monolithic applications are typically developed and deployed as a single unit, while microservices allow for independent development and deployment of individual services.

```python
# Deployment Simulation

import time
import random

def deploy_monolithic():
    print("Deploying Monolithic Application:")
    total_time = 0
    components = ['UI', 'Business Logic', 'Data Access']
    for component in components:
        deploy_time = random.randint(5, 15)
        total_time += deploy_time
        print(f"  Deploying {component}... ({deploy_time} seconds)")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulating deployment time
    print(f"Total deployment time: {total_time} seconds")

def deploy_microservices():
    print("Deploying Microservices:")
    services = ['User Service', 'Product Service', 'Order Service']
    for service in services:
        deploy_time = random.randint(2, 5)
        print(f"  Deploying {service}... ({deploy_time} seconds)")
        time.sleep(1)  # Simulating deployment time

print("Monolithic Deployment:")
deploy_monolithic()
print("\nMicroservices Deployment:")
deploy_microservices()
```

Slide 7: Database Management

Database management is another area where monolithic and microservices architectures differ. Monolithic applications typically use a single, shared database, while microservices often employ a database-per-service pattern, allowing each service to have its own dedicated database.

```python
# Database Management Example

# Monolithic Database
class MonolithicDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}
        self.products = {}
        self.orders = {}

    def add_user(self, user):
        self.users[user['id']] = user

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products[product['id']] = product

    def add_order(self, order):
        self.orders[order['id']] = order

# Microservices Databases
class UserDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}

    def add_user(self, user):
        self.users[user['id']] = user

class ProductDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = {}

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products[product['id']] = product

class OrderDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = {}

    def add_order(self, order):
        self.orders[order['id']] = order

# Usage
monolithic_db = MonolithicDatabase()
monolithic_db.add_user({'id': 1, 'name': 'John'})
monolithic_db.add_product({'id': 1, 'name': 'Widget'})
monolithic_db.add_order({'id': 1, 'user_id': 1, 'product_id': 1})

user_db = UserDatabase()
product_db = ProductDatabase()
order_db = OrderDatabase()
user_db.add_user({'id': 1, 'name': 'John'})
product_db.add_product({'id': 1, 'name': 'Widget'})
order_db.add_order({'id': 1, 'user_id': 1, 'product_id': 1})
```

Slide 8: Fault Isolation

Fault isolation is a significant advantage of microservices architecture. In a monolithic application, a single fault can potentially bring down the entire system. Microservices, however, allow for better fault isolation, where a failure in one service doesn't necessarily affect the others.

```python
import random

def simulate_service_failure(architecture):
    services = ['User Service', 'Product Service', 'Order Service']
    failed_service = random.choice(services)
    
    if architecture == 'Monolithic':
        print(f"Simulating failure in {failed_service} for Monolithic Architecture:")
        print("  Entire application is down!")
        return False
    else:
        print(f"Simulating failure in {failed_service} for Microservices Architecture:")
        for service in services:
            if service == failed_service:
                print(f"  {service} is down!")
            else:
                print(f"  {service} is still operational.")
        return True

print("Monolithic Architecture:")
monolithic_operational = simulate_service_failure('Monolithic')

print("\nMicroservices Architecture:")
microservices_operational = simulate_service_failure('Microservices')

print(f"\nMonolithic fully operational: {monolithic_operational}")
print(f"Microservices partially operational: {microservices_operational}")
```

Slide 9: Technology Diversity

Microservices architecture allows for greater technology diversity, enabling teams to choose the best tools and languages for each service. Monolithic applications, on the other hand, are typically built using a single technology stack.

```python
# Technology Diversity Example

# Monolithic Application (Python)
class MonolithicApp:
    def process_order(self, order):
        # Process order using Python
        pass

    def generate_invoice(self, order):
        # Generate invoice using Python
        pass

    def send_notification(self, user, message):
        # Send notification using Python
        pass

# Microservices Application

# Order Service (Python)
class OrderService:
    def process_order(self, order):
        # Process order using Python
        pass

# Invoice Service (Node.js - represented in Python)
class InvoiceService:
    def generate_invoice(self, order):
        # Simulate Node.js service
        print("Generating invoice using Node.js")

# Notification Service (Go - represented in Python)
class NotificationService:
    def send_notification(self, user, message):
        # Simulate Go service
        print("Sending notification using Go")

# Usage
monolithic_app = MonolithicApp()
monolithic_app.process_order({"id": 1, "items": ["item1", "item2"]})
monolithic_app.generate_invoice({"id": 1, "total": 100})
monolithic_app.send_notification("user1", "Order processed")

order_service = OrderService()
invoice_service = InvoiceService()
notification_service = NotificationService()

order_service.process_order({"id": 1, "items": ["item1", "item2"]})
invoice_service.generate_invoice({"id": 1, "total": 100})
notification_service.send_notification("user1", "Order processed")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: E-commerce Platform

Let's consider an e-commerce platform to illustrate the differences between monolithic and microservices architectures in a real-world scenario.

```python
# Monolithic E-commerce Platform
class MonolithicEcommerce:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}
        self.products = {}
        self.orders = {}
        self.inventory = {}

    def register_user(self, user):
        self.users[user['id']] = user

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products[product['id']] = product
        self.inventory[product['id']] = product['quantity']

    def place_order(self, order):
        if self.check_inventory(order):
            self.orders[order['id']] = order
            self.update_inventory(order)
            self.process_payment(order)
            self.send_confirmation(order)
        else:
            print("Order failed: Insufficient inventory")

    def check_inventory(self, order):
        for item in order['items']:
            if self.inventory[item['product_id']] < item['quantity']:
                return False
        return True

    def update_inventory(self, order):
        for item in order['items']:
            self.inventory[item['product_id']] -= item['quantity']

    def process_payment(self, order):
        print(f"Processing payment for order {order['id']}")

    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        print(f"Sending confirmation for order {order['id']}")

# Usage
monolithic_ecommerce = MonolithicEcommerce()
monolithic_ecommerce.register_user({'id': 1, 'name': 'John Doe'})
monolithic_ecommerce.add_product({'id': 1, 'name': 'Widget', 'quantity': 10})
monolithic_ecommerce.place_order({'id': 1, 'user_id': 1, 'items': [{'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 2}]})
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: E-commerce Platform (Microservices)

Now, let's look at how the same e-commerce platform could be implemented using a microservices architecture.

```python
# Microservices E-commerce Platform

class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}

    def register_user(self, user):
        self.users[user['id']] = user

class ProductService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = {}

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products[product['id']] = product

class InventoryService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = {}

    def update_inventory(self, product_id, quantity):
        self.inventory[product_id] = quantity

    def check_inventory(self, order):
        for item in order['items']:
            if self.inventory[item['product_id']] < item['quantity']:
                return False
        return True

class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, inventory_service):
        self.orders = {}
        self.inventory_service = inventory_service

    def place_order(self, order):
        if self.inventory_service.check_inventory(order):
            self.orders[order['id']] = order
            return True
        return False

class PaymentService:
    def process_payment(self, order):
        print(f"Processing payment for order {order['id']}")

class NotificationService:
    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        print(f"Sending confirmation for order {order['id']}")

# Usage
user_service = UserService()
product_service = ProductService()
inventory_service = InventoryService()
order_service = OrderService(inventory_service)
payment_service = PaymentService()
notification_service = NotificationService()

user_service.register_user({'id': 1, 'name': 'John Doe'})
product_service.add_product({'id': 1, 'name': 'Widget'})
inventory_service.update_inventory(1, 10)
order = {'id': 1, 'user_id': 1, 'items': [{'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 2}]}

if order_service.place_order(order):
    payment_service.process_payment(order)
    notification_service.send_confirmation(order)
else:
    print("Order failed: Insufficient inventory")
```

Slide 12: Performance Considerations

Performance is a crucial aspect to consider when choosing between monolithic and microservices architectures. Each approach has its own performance characteristics that can significantly impact the overall system efficiency.

```python
import time
import random

def simulate_request(architecture):
    if architecture == "Monolithic":
        # Simulate monolithic request processing
        processing_time = random.uniform(0.1, 0.3)
        time.sleep(processing_time)
        return processing_time
    else:
        # Simulate microservices request processing
        service_times = [random.uniform(0.05, 0.1) for _ in range(3)]
        for service_time in service_times:
            time.sleep(service_time)
        return sum(service_times)

def run_performance_test(architecture, num_requests):
    total_time = 0
    for _ in range(num_requests):
        total_time += simulate_request(architecture)
    return total_time / num_requests

# Run performance test
num_requests = 1000
monolithic_avg_time = run_performance_test("Monolithic", num_requests)
microservices_avg_time = run_performance_test("Microservices", num_requests)

print(f"Monolithic average response time: {monolithic_avg_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Microservices average response time: {microservices_avg_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 13: Maintenance and Refactoring

The approach to maintenance and refactoring differs significantly between monolithic and microservices architectures. These differences can have a substantial impact on the long-term evolution and sustainability of a software system.

```python
import random

class CodebaseSimulator:
    def __init__(self, architecture):
        self.architecture = architecture
        self.complexity = 100 if architecture == "Monolithic" else 20
        self.num_components = 1 if architecture == "Monolithic" else 5

    def refactor(self):
        if self.architecture == "Monolithic":
            # Monolithic refactoring affects the entire codebase
            improvement = random.randint(5, 15)
            self.complexity = max(0, self.complexity - improvement)
            print(f"Monolithic refactoring: Complexity reduced to {self.complexity}")
        else:
            # Microservices refactoring affects individual services
            service = random.randint(1, self.num_components)
            improvement = random.randint(1, 5)
            self.complexity = max(0, self.complexity - improvement)
            print(f"Microservice {service} refactored: Overall complexity reduced to {self.complexity}")

# Simulate refactoring over time
monolithic = CodebaseSimulator("Monolithic")
microservices = CodebaseSimulator("Microservices")

for _ in range(5):
    print("\nRefactoring iteration:")
    monolithic.refactor()
    microservices.refactor()

print("\nFinal complexity:")
print(f"Monolithic: {monolithic.complexity}")
print(f"Microservices: {microservices.complexity}")
```

Slide 14: Conclusion

Monolithic and microservices architectures each have their strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on various factors such as project size, team structure, scalability requirements, and development goals. Monolithic architectures can be simpler for smaller projects and teams, while microservices offer greater flexibility and scalability for larger, more complex systems. Understanding these differences is crucial for making informed architectural decisions in software development.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Factors to consider
factors = ['Scalability', 'Complexity', 'Development Speed', 'Deployment Ease', 'Fault Isolation']
monolithic_scores = [2, 4, 4, 3, 2]
microservices_scores = [5, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Creating the comparison chart
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
x = range(len(factors))
width = 0.35

ax.bar([i - width/2 for i in x], monolithic_scores, width, label='Monolithic', color='skyblue')
ax.bar([i + width/2 for i in x], microservices_scores, width, label='Microservices', color='lightgreen')

ax.set_ylabel('Score')
ax.set_title('Monolithic vs Microservices Comparison')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(factors, rotation=45, ha='right')
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
