## Python Prefetching for Efficient Handling of Huge Data Sets

Slide 1: Introduction to Python Prefetching

Prefetching is a technique used to optimize data access by loading data into memory before it's actually needed. This can significantly improve performance when working with huge datasets.

```python
import prefetch_generator

@prefetch_generator.background()
def data_generator():
    for i in range(1000000):
        # Simulate time-consuming data retrieval
        time.sleep(0.1)
        yield f"Data item {i}"

# Usage
for item in data_generator():
    print(item)
```

Slide 2: Memory-Mapped Files

Memory-mapped files allow you to access file content as if it were in memory, which can be faster than traditional file I/O for large datasets.

```python
import mmap

with open('large_file.dat', 'rb') as f:
    mmapped_file = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)
    
# Read data from the memory-mapped file
data = mmapped_file[1000:2000]
```

Slide 3: NumPy Memory-Mapped Arrays

NumPy provides efficient memory-mapped array operations, which are particularly useful for large numerical datasets.

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a memory-mapped array
mmap_array = np.memmap('large_array.dat', dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(1000000,))

# Perform operations on the array
mmap_array[:1000] = np.random.random(1000)

# Flush changes to disk
mmap_array.flush()
```

Slide 4: Pandas Chunking

Pandas allows you to process large datasets in chunks, reducing memory usage and enabling efficient processing of data that doesn't fit in memory.

```python
import pandas as pd

chunk_size = 100000
for chunk in pd.read_csv('huge_dataset.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    # Process each chunk
    processed_chunk = chunk.apply(some_processing_function)
    
    # Save or accumulate results
    processed_chunk.to_csv('processed_data.csv', mode='a', header=False, index=False)
```

Slide 5: Dask for Parallel Computing

Dask provides parallel computing tools that can handle larger-than-memory datasets by breaking them into smaller chunks.

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Read a large CSV file into a Dask DataFrame
ddf = dd.read_csv('huge_dataset.csv')

# Perform operations on the Dask DataFrame
result = ddf.groupby('column_name').mean().compute()
```

Slide 6: Itertools for Efficient Iteration

Python's itertools module provides memory-efficient tools for working with iterators, which can be useful when processing large datasets.

```python
from itertools import islice

def chunk_generator(iterable, chunk_size):
    iterator = iter(iterable)
    return iter(lambda: list(islice(iterator, chunk_size)), [])

# Usage
large_list = range(1000000)
for chunk in chunk_generator(large_list, 1000):
    process_chunk(chunk)
```

Slide 7: Generators for Lazy Evaluation

Generators allow for lazy evaluation of data, which can significantly reduce memory usage when working with large datasets.

```python
def large_data_generator():
    for i in range(1000000):
        # Simulate data retrieval or generation
        yield f"Data item {i}"

# Process data without loading everything into memory
for item in large_data_generator():
    process_item(item)
```

Slide 8: Multiprocessing for Parallel Data Processing

The multiprocessing module allows you to leverage multiple CPU cores for parallel data processing.

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def process_chunk(chunk):
    return [item * 2 for item in chunk]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    large_data = range(1000000)
    chunk_size = 100000
    chunks = [large_data[i:i+chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(large_data), chunk_size)]
    
    with Pool() as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_chunk, chunks)
```

Slide 9: PyTables for HDF5 File Format

PyTables provides an efficient way to work with HDF5 files, which are well-suited for storing and accessing large datasets.

```python
import tables

class Particle(tables.IsDescription):
    name = tables.StringCol(16)
    x = tables.Float32Col()
    y = tables.Float32Col()

with tables.open_file("particles.h5", mode="w") as h5file:
    table = h5file.create_table("/", 'particles', Particle)
    
    # Add data to the table
    particle = table.row
    for i in range(1000000):
        particle['name'] = f'particle_{i}'
        particle['x'] = i
        particle['y'] = i * 2
        particle.append()
    
    # Flush the table to disk
    table.flush()
```

Slide 10: Asynchronous I/O with aiofiles

Asynchronous I/O can improve performance when dealing with multiple files or network resources.

```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles

async def process_file(filename):
    async with aiofiles.open(filename, mode='r') as f:
        contents = await f.read()
    return len(contents)

async def main():
    files = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']
    tasks = [process_file(file) for file in files]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Slide 11: Vaex for Out-of-Core DataFrames

Vaex is a Python library that provides out-of-core DataFrames for processing large datasets that don't fit in memory.

```python
import vaex

# Open a large CSV file
df = vaex.from_csv('huge_dataset.csv', convert=True)

# Perform operations on the DataFrame
result = df.mean(['column1', 'column2'])

# Export results
df.export_hdf5('processed_data.hdf5')
```

Slide 12: Numba for JIT Compilation

Numba can significantly speed up numerical Python code through just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

```python
from numba import jit
import numpy as np

@jit(nopython=True)
def process_array(arr):
    result = np.empty_like(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        result[i] = arr[i] ** 2 + 2 * arr[i] - 1
    return result

# Usage
large_array = np.random.random(1000000)
processed = process_array(large_array)
```

Slide 13: Efficient String Processing with re2

The re2 library provides a fast alternative to Python's built-in regex engine, which can be beneficial for processing large text datasets.

```python
import re2

# Compile the regex pattern
pattern = re2.compile(r'\b\w+\b')

def count_words(text):
    return len(pattern.findall(text))

# Process a large text file
with open('large_text_file.txt', 'r') as f:
    total_words = sum(count_words(line) for line in f)

print(f"Total words: {total_words}")
```
