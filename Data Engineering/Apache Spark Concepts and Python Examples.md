## Apache Spark Concepts and Python Examples
Slide 1: Introduction to Apache Spark

Apache Spark is a powerful open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing and analytics. It provides a unified engine for large-scale data processing tasks, offering high performance for both batch and real-time stream processing. Spark's in-memory computing capabilities and support for multiple programming languages make it a versatile tool for data scientists and engineers.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Introduction to Spark") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Charlie", 35)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

# Show the DataFrame
df.show()
```

Slide 2: Spark's Core Concepts: RDDs

Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are the fundamental data structure in Spark. They are immutable, distributed collections of objects that can be processed in parallel across a cluster. RDDs provide fault tolerance through lineage information, allowing Spark to reconstruct lost data by recomputing it from the original source.

```python
# Create an RDD from a list
numbers = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform transformations on the RDD
squared = numbers.map(lambda x: x ** 2)

# Collect and print the results
print(squared.collect())
```

Slide 3: Spark DataFrames

Spark DataFrames provide a higher-level abstraction built on top of RDDs. They organize data into named columns, similar to tables in a relational database. DataFrames offer a more intuitive API for working with structured data and enable Spark to perform optimizations on query execution.

```python
# Create a DataFrame from a list of tuples
data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Charlie", 35)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])

# Perform operations on the DataFrame
df_filtered = df.filter(df.Age > 28)
df_filtered.show()
```

Slide 4: Spark SQL

Spark SQL is a module for working with structured data using SQL queries. It allows you to query DataFrames using SQL syntax and integrates seamlessly with Spark's programming APIs. Spark SQL also provides a unified interface for reading and writing data in various formats, such as JSON, Parquet, and Avro.

```python
# Register the DataFrame as a temporary SQL table
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# Run a SQL query on the table
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE Age > 28")
result.show()
```

Slide 5: Spark Transformations and Actions

Spark operations are categorized into transformations and actions. Transformations are lazy operations that define a new RDD without immediately computing its results. Actions, on the other hand, trigger the execution of all preceding transformations and return results to the driver program.

```python
# Transformation: filter
filtered_rdd = numbers.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)

# Transformation: map
squared_rdd = filtered_rdd.map(lambda x: x ** 2)

# Action: collect
result = squared_rdd.collect()
print(result)
```

Slide 6: Spark Partitioning

Partitioning is a crucial concept in Spark for optimizing data distribution across a cluster. It determines how data is split and processed in parallel. Proper partitioning can significantly improve performance by reducing data shuffling and balancing the workload across executors.

```python
# Create an RDD with custom partitioning
custom_partitioned_rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(
    range(100), numSlices=4
)

# Show the number of partitions
print(f"Number of partitions: {custom_partitioned_rdd.getNumPartitions()}")

# Perform an action to trigger computation
print(custom_partitioned_rdd.glom().collect())
```

Slide 7: Spark Streaming

Spark Streaming enables the processing of real-time data streams. It divides the input data stream into small batches and processes them using Spark's core engine. This allows for the application of the same code and APIs used for batch processing to streaming data, providing a unified approach to data processing.

```python
from pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext

# Create a StreamingContext with a 1-second batch interval
ssc = StreamingContext(spark.sparkContext, 1)

# Create a DStream that connects to a socket
lines = ssc.socketTextStream("localhost", 9999)

# Count the number of words in each batch
word_counts = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" ")) \
                   .map(lambda word: (word, 1)) \
                   .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)

# Print the results
word_counts.pprint()

# Start the streaming context
ssc.start()
ssc.awaitTermination()
```

Slide 8: Spark MLlib

Spark MLlib is Spark's machine learning library, providing a wide range of algorithms and utilities for machine learning tasks. It includes tools for feature extraction, classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation. MLlib is designed to scale efficiently to large datasets and integrate seamlessly with other Spark components.

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

# Prepare the data
data = [(1, 2.0), (2, 4.0), (3, 6.0), (4, 8.0), (5, 10.0)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["x", "y"])

# Create feature vector
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["x"], outputCol="features")
df_assembled = assembler.transform(df)

# Train a linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="y")
model = lr.fit(df_assembled)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(df_assembled)
predictions.show()
```

Slide 9: Spark GraphX

GraphX is Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation. It extends the Spark RDD abstraction to include Graphs, consisting of vertices and edges with properties attached to each. GraphX includes a collection of graph algorithms and builders to simplify graph analytics tasks.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from graphframes import GraphFrame

# Create vertices DataFrame
vertices = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("1", "Alice"), ("2", "Bob"), ("3", "Charlie")
], ["id", "name"])

# Create edges DataFrame
edges = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("1", "2", "friend"), ("2", "3", "colleague"), ("3", "1", "family")
], ["src", "dst", "relationship"])

# Create a GraphFrame
g = GraphFrame(vertices, edges)

# Run PageRank algorithm
results = g.pageRank(resetProbability=0.15, tol=0.01)
results.vertices.select("id", "name", "pagerank").show()
```

Slide 10: Spark Performance Tuning

Optimizing Spark applications involves various techniques to improve performance and resource utilization. This includes proper data partitioning, caching frequently used data, and managing memory usage. Spark provides several configuration options and APIs to fine-tune application performance.

```python
# Example of caching a DataFrame
df.cache()

# Example of repartitioning
df_repartitioned = df.repartition(10)

# Example of persistence with a specific storage level
from pyspark import StorageLevel
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)

# Unpersist when no longer needed
df.unpersist()
```

Slide 11: Spark Deployment Models

Spark supports various deployment modes to suit different use cases and environments. These include local mode for development and testing, standalone cluster mode for simple setups, and resource managers like YARN or Kubernetes for production environments. Understanding these deployment options is crucial for efficiently running Spark applications at scale.

```python
# Example of submitting a Spark application to a YARN cluster
# (This would typically be run from the command line, not within a Python script)

"""
spark-submit \
    --master yarn \
    --deploy-mode cluster \
    --driver-memory 4g \
    --executor-memory 2g \
    --executor-cores 1 \
    --num-executors 3 \
    your_spark_app.py
"""

# Within your Spark application, you can check the current master
print(spark.sparkContext.master)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Log Analysis

In this example, we'll demonstrate how Spark can be used for analyzing large log files. This is a common use case in many industries for monitoring system performance, detecting anomalies, or tracking user behavior.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import split, regexp_extract

# Assume we have a large log file in HDFS
logs = spark.read.text("hdfs://path/to/large/logfile.txt")

# Parse the log entries
parsed_logs = logs.select(
    regexp_extract('value', r'^(\S+)', 1).alias('ip'),
    regexp_extract('value', r'.*\[(\d{2}/\w{3}/\d{4}:\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})', 1).alias('date'),
    regexp_extract('value', r'.*"(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)"', 2).alias('url'),
    regexp_extract('value', r'.*"\s+(\d+)', 1).cast('integer').alias('status')
)

# Count the number of requests per status code
status_counts = parsed_logs.groupBy('status').count().orderBy('status')
status_counts.show()

# Find the top 10 most frequently accessed URLs
top_urls = parsed_logs.groupBy('url').count().orderBy('count', ascending=False).limit(10)
top_urls.show()
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Sensor Data Analysis

This example demonstrates how Spark can be used to process and analyze sensor data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This is applicable in various domains such as smart cities, industrial monitoring, and environmental sensing.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import window, avg, max

# Assume we have streaming sensor data
sensor_data = spark \
    .readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "sensor_topic") \
    .load()

# Parse the JSON data
parsed_data = sensor_data.select(
    sensor_data.value.cast("string").alias("json_data")
).selectExpr("from_json(json_data, 'sensor_id STRING, temperature DOUBLE, humidity DOUBLE, timestamp TIMESTAMP') AS data")

# Extract fields
sensor_df = parsed_data.select("data.*")

# Perform windowed aggregations
windowed_avg = sensor_df \
    .groupBy(
        window(sensor_df.timestamp, "1 hour"),
        sensor_df.sensor_id
    ) \
    .agg(
        avg("temperature").alias("avg_temp"),
        avg("humidity").alias("avg_humidity"),
        max("temperature").alias("max_temp")
    )

# Start the streaming query
query = windowed_avg \
    .writeStream \
    .outputMode("complete") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()

query.awaitTermination()
```
