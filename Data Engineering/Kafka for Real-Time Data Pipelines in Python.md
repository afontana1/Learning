## Kafka for Real-Time Data Pipelines in Python
Slide 1: 

Introduction to Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-volume and high-velocity data streams, making it an ideal choice for building scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

```python
# Import the necessary Kafka library
from kafka import KafkaProducer

# Create a Kafka producer instance
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Send a message to a Kafka topic
producer.send('my-topic', b'Hello, Kafka!')
producer.flush()
```

Slide 2: 

Kafka Architecture

Kafka follows a simple yet powerful architecture, consisting of producers, brokers, topics, partitions, and consumers. Producers publish messages to topics, brokers store and manage the messages, and consumers subscribe to topics and consume the messages.

```python
# Import the necessary Kafka library
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

# Create a Kafka consumer instance
consumer = KafkaConsumer('my-topic', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Consume messages from the topic
for msg in consumer:
    print(msg.value)
```

Slide 3: 

Kafka Topics and Partitions

In Kafka, data is organized into topics, which are further divided into partitions. Partitions allow for parallel processing and scalability, as messages within a partition are ordered and consumed sequentially, while messages across partitions can be consumed concurrently.

```python
# Create a topic with 3 partitions
from kafka.admin import KafkaAdminClient

admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
topic_list = []
topic_list.append(NewTopic(name="my-topic", num_partitions=3, replication_factor=1))
admin_client.create_topics(new_topics=topic_list, validate_only=False)
```

Slide 4: 

Producers and Consumers

Producers in Kafka are responsible for publishing messages to topics, while consumers subscribe to topics and consume the messages. Consumers can be part of a consumer group, where each message is delivered to one consumer instance within the group.

```python
# Publish a message to a Kafka topic
producer.send('my-topic', b'Hello, Kafka!')

# Consume messages from a Kafka topic
consumer = KafkaConsumer('my-topic', group_id='my-group', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
for msg in consumer:
    print(msg.value)
```

Slide 5: 

Kafka Brokers and Clusters

Kafka brokers are the servers that store and manage the messages. Brokers can be organized into clusters, which provide fault tolerance, scalability, and load balancing. Replication and partition leaders ensure data availability and durability.

```python
# List available Kafka brokers
from kafka import KafkaClient

kafka_client = KafkaClient(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
brokers = kafka_client.bootstrap_connected()
print(brokers)
```

Slide 6: 

Kafka and Uber Ride-sharing

Uber uses Kafka extensively for various real-time data streaming and processing tasks, such as tracking ride requests, driver locations, and billing events. Kafka's high throughput and low latency make it an ideal choice for such a large-scale distributed system.

```python
# Simulating an Uber ride request event
from kafka import KafkaProducer

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
ride_request = {
    'user_id': 123,
    'pickup_location': (40.7128, -74.0060),  # New York City coordinates
    'destination': (51.5072, -0.1276)  # London coordinates
}
producer.send('ride-requests', bytes(str(ride_request), 'utf-8'))
```

Slide 7: 

Kafka Streaming with Uber

Kafka can be used to stream and process real-time data from various sources, such as rider and driver apps, payment systems, and analytics platforms. This enables Uber to provide a seamless experience and make data-driven decisions.

```python
# Simulating real-time processing of Uber ride events
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

consumer = KafkaConsumer('ride-events', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
for msg in consumer:
    event = eval(msg.value)
    if event['event_type'] == 'ride_request':
        print(f"Processing ride request from user {event['user_id']}")
    elif event['event_type'] == 'ride_completed':
        print(f"Ride completed for user {event['user_id']}")
```

Slide 8: 

Kafka and Microservices

Kafka is often used as a backbone for microservices architectures, enabling decoupled and asynchronous communication between services. This allows for greater scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility in large distributed systems like Uber.

```python
# Simulating a microservice architecture with Kafka
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer

# Billing microservice
billing_producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Ride matching microservice
consumer = KafkaConsumer('ride-requests', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
for msg in consumer:
    ride_request = eval(msg.value)
    # Match rider with driver
    driver_id = match_rider_with_driver(ride_request)
    billing_producer.send('billing-events', bytes(str({'user_id': ride_request['user_id'], 'driver_id': driver_id}), 'utf-8'))
```

Slide 9: 

Kafka and Scalability

Kafka's distributed architecture and partitioning model allow for horizontal scaling by adding more brokers and partitions as the data volume grows. This scalability is crucial for handling the massive amounts of data generated by Uber's global operations.

```python
# Simulating scaling a Kafka topic by adding partitions
from kafka.admin import KafkaAdminClient

admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
topic_partitions = {}
topic_partitions['my-topic'] = NewPartitions(total_count=6)
admin_client.create_partitions(topic_partitions)
```

Slide 10: 

Kafka and Fault Tolerance

Kafka provides fault tolerance through replication and automatic leader election. If a broker fails, a new leader is elected for the partitions hosted on that broker, ensuring continuous data availability and processing.

```python
# Simulating broker failure and leader election
from kafka.admin import KafkaAdminClient

admin_client = KafkaAdminClient(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
topic_description = admin_client.describe_topics(['my-topic'])
partition_metadata = topic_description['my-topic'].partitions[0].partition
print(f"Current leader for partition 0: {partition_metadata.leader}")

# Simulate broker failure
admin_client.remove_partitions(['my-topic'])

# Leader election will happen automatically
```

Slide 11: 

Kafka and Real-time Analytics

Kafka can be integrated with various real-time analytics and data processing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Apache Flink, to enable real-time insights and decision-making based on streaming data.

```python
# Simulating real-time analytics with Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("KafkaStreamingAnalytics").getOrCreate()

df = spark \
    .readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "ride-events") \
    .load()

ride_stats = df \
    .select(col("value").cast("string")) \
    .withColumn("ride_event", from_json(col("value"), "map<string, string>")) \
    .select("ride_event.*") \
    .groupBy("event_type") \
    .count()

query = ride_stats \
    .writeStream \
    .outputMode("complete") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()

query.awaitTermination()
```

Slide 12: 

Kafka and Real-time Monitoring

Kafka can be used to stream and monitor real-time data from various sources, such as application logs, system metrics, and user interactions, enabling proactive issue detection and resolution.

```python
# Simulating real-time monitoring with Kafka
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
import random

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# Simulate application log events
while True:
    log_event = {
        'timestamp': str(datetime.now()),
        'level': random.choice(['INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR']),
        'message': 'Simulated log message'
    }
    producer.send('app-logs', bytes(json.dumps(log_event), 'utf-8'))
    time.sleep(1)
```

Slide 13: 

Kafka and Event-Driven Architecture

Kafka enables an event-driven architecture, where components communicate through events rather than direct calls, promoting loose coupling and scalability. This is particularly useful in complex distributed systems like Uber.

```python
# Simulating an event-driven architecture with Kafka
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer

# Producer service
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
ride_request = {
    'user_id': 123,
    'pickup_location': (40.7128, -74.0060),
    'destination': (51.5072, -0.1276)
}
producer.send('ride-requests', bytes(str(ride_request), 'utf-8'))

# Consumer service
consumer = KafkaConsumer('ride-requests', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
for msg in consumer:
    ride_request = eval(msg.value)
    driver_id = match_rider_with_driver(ride_request)
    producer.send('ride-assignments', bytes(str({'user_id': ride_request['user_id'], 'driver_id': driver_id}), 'utf-8'))
```
