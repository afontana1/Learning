## Data Warehousing and Dimensional Modeling for Machine Learning Using Python

Slide 1: 

Introduction to Data Warehousing and Dimensional Modeling

Data warehousing is a process of collecting and storing data from multiple sources for analysis and reporting. Dimensional modeling is a technique used in data warehousing to organize data into a star schema or a snowflake schema, making it easier to query and analyze.

Slide 2: 

Setting up a Data Warehouse with Python

In this slide, we'll explore how to set up a data warehouse using Python and a database management system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="data_warehouse",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)

# Create a cursor
cur = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE sales (
                  product_id INT,
                  customer_id INT,
                  sale_date DATE,
                  quantity INT,
                  price FLOAT
              )""")

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

Slide 3: 

Data Extraction and Transformation

This slide demonstrates how to extract data from various sources and transform it into a format suitable for loading into the data warehouse.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Extract data from a CSV file
sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales.csv')

# Transform the data
sales_data['sale_date'] = pd.to_datetime(sales_data['sale_date'])
sales_data['total_revenue'] = sales_data['quantity'] * sales_data['price']

# Save the transformed data to a new CSV file
sales_data.to_csv('transformed_sales.csv', index=False)
```

Slide 4: 

Creating a Star Schema

The star schema is a dimensional modeling technique where a central fact table is surrounded by dimension tables. This slide shows how to create a star schema in a data warehouse.

```python
# Create a fact table
cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
                  sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                  product_id INT,
                  customer_id INT,
                  sale_date DATE,
                  quantity INT,
                  price FLOAT
              )""")

# Create dimension tables
cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE product_dim (
                  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                  product_name VARCHAR(100),
                  category VARCHAR(50)
              )""")

cur.execute("""CREATE TABLE customer_dim (
                  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                  customer_name VARCHAR(100),
                  city VARCHAR(50),
                  state VARCHAR(50)
              )""")
```

Slide 5: 

Loading Data into the Star Schema

After creating the star schema, we can load data from the transformed dataset into the fact and dimension tables.

```python
# Load data into the fact table
insert_query = """
    INSERT INTO sales_fact (product_id, customer_id, sale_date, quantity, price)
    SELECT product_id, customer_id, sale_date, quantity, price
    FROM transformed_sales
"""
cur.execute(insert_query)

# Load data into the dimension tables
# ... (code for loading data into product_dim and customer_dim)

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()
```

Slide 6: 

Querying the Star Schema

With the data loaded into the star schema, we can perform analytical queries to gain insights from the data.

```python
# Query to get total revenue by product category
query = """
    SELECT p.category, SUM(f.quantity * f.price) AS total_revenue
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN product_dim p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY p.category
"""
cur.execute(query)
results = cur.fetchall()

# Print the results
for category, revenue in results:
    print(f"Category: {category}, Total Revenue: {revenue}")
```

Slide 7: 

Introduction to Dimensional Modeling for Machine Learning

Dimensional modeling can be beneficial for machine learning tasks by providing a structured and optimized data layout for analysis and modeling.

Slide 8: 

Preparing Data for Machine Learning

This slide demonstrates how to extract data from the star schema and prepare it for machine learning tasks.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Query to get the required features and target variable
query = """
    SELECT p.category, c.city, c.state, f.quantity, f.price
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN product_dim p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN customer_dim c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id
"""
cur.execute(query)
data = cur.fetchall()

# Separate features and target variable
X = np.array([[row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3]] for row in data])
y = np.array([row[4] for row in data])

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Slide 9: 

Building a Machine Learning Model

This slide demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using the prepared data from the star schema.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {score}")
```

lide 10: 

Optimizing Dimensional Models for Machine Learning

Dimensional models can be optimized for machine learning tasks by denormalizing the data and using techniques like indexing and partitioning.

```python
# Denormalize the star schema by creating a flattened table
create_query = """
    CREATE TABLE flattened_sales AS
    SELECT p.category, c.city, c.state, f.quantity, f.price
    FROM sales_fact f
    JOIN product_dim p ON f.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN customer_dim c ON f.customer_id = c.customer_id
"""
cur.execute(create_query)

# Create indexes for faster querying
cur.execute("CREATE INDEX ON flattened_sales (category, city, state)")

# Partition the table for better performance
cur.execute("ALTER TABLE flattened_sales PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date)")
```

Slide 11: 

Advanced Dimensional Modeling Techniques

This slide covers two advanced dimensional modeling techniques: slowly changing dimensions and junk dimensions.

```python
# Slowly changing dimensions
# Create a new column in the customer_dim table to track changes
cur.execute("""
    ALTER TABLE customer_dim
    ADD COLUMN effective_date DATE,
    ADD COLUMN expiration_date DATE
""")

# Junk dimensions
# Create a junk dimension table to store miscellaneous data
cur.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE junk_dim (
        junk_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        attribute VARCHAR(100),
        description VARCHAR(200)
    )
""")
```

Slide 12: 

Monitoring and Maintaining a Data Warehouse

Monitoring and maintaining a data warehouse involves tracking data quality, ensuring data consistency, and optimizing performance.

```python
# Monitor data quality by checking for null values, duplicates, and outliers
quality_query = """
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
    FROM sales_fact
    WHERE product_id IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL
"""
cur.execute(quality_query)
null_count = cur.fetchone()[0]
print(f"Number of rows with null values: {null_count}")

# Ensure data consistency by enforcing constraints and triggers
# ... (code for creating constraints and triggers)

# Optimize performance by analyzing and vacuuming tables
cur.execute("ANALYZE VERBOSE sales_fact")
cur.execute("VACUUM FULL sales_fact")
```

Slide 13: 

Integrating Data Warehousing and Machine Learning

Integrating data warehousing and machine learning involves combining the structured data from the data warehouse with machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and decision-making.

```python
# Query the data warehouse for training data
query = "SELECT * FROM flattened_sales"
cur.execute(query)
data = cur.fetchall()

# Separate features and target variable
X = np.array([[row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3]] for row in data])
y = np.array([row[4] for row in data])

# Build and train a machine learning model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)

# Use the trained model for predictions
new_data = [[...]]  # New data to be predicted
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
print(f"Predicted value: {prediction}")
```
