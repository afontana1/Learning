    plt.text(0.5, i, c, va='center')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm with a time complexity of O(nd), where n is the number of samples and d is the number of features. This efficiency makes it suitable for large datasets with many features.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.rand(n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 3: Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression, despite its name, is used for classification tasks. Its time complexity is also O(nd), making it efficient for binary and multiclass classification problems with large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 4: Decision Trees

Decision Trees have a time complexity of O(nd log n) for training. This makes them relatively efficient for medium-sized datasets but may become slower for very large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 5: Random Forests

Random Forests, an ensemble of Decision Trees, have a time complexity of O(ntd log n), where t is the number of trees. While more computationally intensive than a single Decision Tree, they often provide better performance and are parallelizable.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100).fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 6: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVMs have a time complexity of O(n^2d) to O(n^3d) depending on the kernel used. This quadratic to cubic relationship with the number of samples makes SVMs challenging to use with large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 1000, 100  # Reduced sample size due to SVM's complexity
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = SVC().fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 7: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN has a training complexity of O(nd) (essentially just storing the data) but a prediction complexity of O(nd) per sample. This makes it quick to train but potentially slow for predictions on large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting and predicting
start_time = time.time()
model = KNeighborsClassifier().fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X[:100])  # Predict for first 100 samples
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for fitting and predicting: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 8: K-Means Clustering

K-Means has a time complexity of O(ndk), where k is the number of clusters. This makes it relatively efficient for small to medium-sized datasets but can become slow for large datasets or high numbers of clusters.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = KMeans(n_clusters=5).fit(X)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 9: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA has a time complexity of O(d^3) where d is the number of dimensions. This cubic relationship with dimensions makes PCA potentially slow for high-dimensional data.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = PCA().fit(X)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 10: Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes has a time complexity of O(nd), making it one of the fastest algorithms for training and prediction. This efficiency makes it suitable for very large datasets.

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = GaussianNB().fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 11: Neural Networks

The time complexity of Neural Networks varies greatly depending on the architecture, but it's generally O(nde) where e is the number of epochs. This can make them computationally intensive for large datasets or complex architectures.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate sample data
n, d = 10000, 100
X = np.random.rand(n, d)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Measure time for fitting
start_time = time.time()
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), max_iter=100).fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken for {n} samples and {d} features: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example - Image Classification

In image classification tasks, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact processing time. For a dataset of 10,000 images, each 200x200 pixels:

```python
import numpy as np
import time
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Simulate image data
n, width, height = 10000, 200, 200
X = np.random.rand(n, width * height)
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, n)

# SVM
start_time = time.time()
svm = SVC().fit(X[:1000], y[:1000])  # Using subset due to SVM's complexity
svm_time = time.time() - start_time

# Random Forest
start_time = time.time()
rf = RandomForestClassifier().fit(X, y)
rf_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"SVM time (1000 samples): {svm_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Random Forest time (10000 samples): {rf_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example - Text Classification

For text classification tasks, such as spam detection on a dataset of 100,000 emails:

```python
import numpy as np
import time
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Simulate text data
n = 100000
texts = [f"Sample email text {i}" for i in range(n)]
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, n)

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Naive Bayes
start_time = time.time()
nb = MultinomialNB().fit(X, y)
nb_time = time.time() - start_time

# Logistic Regression
start_time = time.time()
lr = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
lr_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Naive Bayes time: {nb_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Logistic Regression time: {lr_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 14: Choosing the Right Algorithm

When selecting an ML algorithm, consider:

1. Dataset size: Large datasets may require algorithms with lower time complexity.
2. Feature dimensionality: High-dimensional data can slow down certain algorithms.
3. Model interpretability: Some faster algorithms may sacrifice interpretability.
4. Prediction speed: Consider both training and prediction time complexities.
5. Accuracy requirements: More complex algorithms might offer better performance at the cost of longer run times.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def complexity(n, d, algorithm):
    if algorithm == 'Linear':
        return n * d
    elif algorithm == 'Quadratic':
        return n**2 * d
    elif algorithm == 'Log-linear':
        return n * np.log(n) * d

n_range = np.logspace(2, 6, num=100)
d = 100

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for algo in ['Linear', 'Quadratic', 'Log-linear']:
    times = [complexity(n, d, algo) for n in n_range]
    plt.loglog(n_range, times, label=algo)

plt.xlabel('Number of samples')
plt.ylabel('Relative time')
plt.title('Algorithm Complexity vs Dataset Size')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
