## Hidden Markov Models for Automatic Speech Recognition in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Hidden Markov Models for ASR

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models widely used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. They represent speech as a sequence of hidden states, each emitting observable features. In ASR, these states typically correspond to phonemes or sub-phoneme units, while the observations are acoustic features extracted from the speech signal.

```python
import numpy as np
from hmmlearn import hmm

# Create a simple HMM for speech recognition
model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=3, covariance_type="full")
model.startprob_ = np.array([0.6, 0.3, 0.1])
model.transmat_ = np.array([[0.7, 0.2, 0.1],
                            [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],
                            [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]])
model.means_ = np.array([[0.0, 0.0], [3.0, -3.0], [5.0, 10.0]])
model.covars_ = np.tile(np.identity(2), (3, 1, 1))

# Generate sample data
X, Z = model.sample(100)
```

Slide 2: Components of an HMM

An HMM consists of three main components: states, transitions, and emissions. States represent the underlying phonetic units, transitions model the probability of moving from one state to another, and emissions define the probability of observing specific acoustic features given a state.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Visualize the HMM components
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=Z, cmap=plt.cm.Set1)
plt.title("HMM States and Emissions")
plt.xlabel("Feature 1")
plt.ylabel("Feature 2")
plt.colorbar(ticks=range(model.n_components), label="State")
plt.show()

# Print transition matrix
print("Transition Matrix:")
print(model.transmat_)
```

Slide 3: Feature Extraction for ASR

Before applying HMMs, we need to extract relevant features from the speech signal. Common features include Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which capture the spectral envelope of the speech signal.

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display

# Load audio file
audio_file = "speech_sample.wav"
y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file)

# Extract MFCCs
mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)

# Visualize MFCCs
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
librosa.display.specshow(mfccs, x_axis='time')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('MFCC')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Training HMMs for ASR

Training HMMs for ASR involves estimating the model parameters (transition probabilities, emission probabilities) using a large corpus of labeled speech data. The Baum-Welch algorithm, a variant of Expectation-Maximization, is commonly used for this purpose.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assume we have a dataset of MFCCs and their corresponding labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(mfccs.T, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Train the HMM
model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=5, covariance_type="diag", n_iter=100)
model.fit(X_train)

# Print the converged log-likelihood
print(f"Model converged with log-likelihood: {model.score(X_train)}")
```

Slide 5: Decoding in ASR

Decoding is the process of finding the most likely sequence of states (phonemes) given the observed acoustic features. The Viterbi algorithm is commonly used for this purpose in HMM-based ASR systems.

```python
# Assuming we have a trained HMM model and a new observation sequence
new_observation = X_test[0]

# Perform Viterbi decoding
log_prob, state_sequence = model.decode(new_observation.reshape(1, -1))

print("Most likely state sequence:")
print(state_sequence)
print(f"Log probability: {log_prob}")
```

Slide 6: Handling Continuous Speech

In continuous speech recognition, we need to deal with connected words and sentences. This involves modeling word transitions and using language models to improve recognition accuracy.

```python
import networkx as nx

# Simple language model represented as a graph
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([("START", "THE"), ("THE", "CAT"), ("THE", "DOG"),
                  ("CAT", "IS"), ("DOG", "IS"), ("IS", "ON"),
                  ("ON", "THE"), ("THE", "MAT"), ("MAT", "END")])

# Visualize the language model
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=500, arrowsize=20)
plt.title("Simple Language Model for ASR")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Real-life Example: Voice Command Recognition

HMMs can be used to build a simple voice command recognition system for home automation. We'll train separate HMMs for different commands like "Turn on lights", "Set temperature", and "Play music".

```python
# Assume we have extracted MFCCs for different voice commands
commands = ["lights_on", "set_temp", "play_music"]
models = {}

for command in commands:
    model = hmm.GaussianHMM(n_components=5, covariance_type="diag", n_iter=100)
    model.fit(command_data[command])
    models[command] = model

# Function to recognize a new command
def recognize_command(audio):
    mfccs = extract_mfccs(audio)
    scores = {cmd: model.score(mfccs) for cmd, model in models.items()}
    recognized_command = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    return recognized_command

# Example usage
new_audio = record_audio(duration=3)
result = recognize_command(new_audio)
print(f"Recognized command: {result}")
```

Slide 8: Handling Noise and Variability

Real-world speech recognition must handle various challenges such as background noise, speaker variability, and channel effects. Techniques like noise reduction and speaker adaptation can improve robustness.

```python
import numpy as np

def add_noise(signal, snr_db):
    signal_power = np.sum(signal ** 2) / len(signal)
    noise_power = signal_power / (10 ** (snr_db / 10))
    noise = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(noise_power), len(signal))
    return signal + noise

# Example usage
clean_signal = np.random.randn(1000)
noisy_signal = add_noise(clean_signal, snr_db=10)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.subplot(211)
plt.title("Clean Signal")
plt.plot(clean_signal)
plt.subplot(212)
plt.title("Noisy Signal (SNR = 10 dB)")
plt.plot(noisy_signal)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Integrating Language Models

Language models help improve ASR accuracy by incorporating prior knowledge about word sequences. N-gram models are commonly used to estimate the probability of word sequences.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Simple bigram language model
class BigramModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bigrams = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        self.word_counts = defaultdict(int)

    def train(self, corpus):
        words = corpus.split()
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            self.bigrams[words[i]][words[i+1]] += 1
            self.word_counts[words[i]] += 1

    def probability(self, word1, word2):
        return self.bigrams[word1][word2] / self.word_counts[word1]

# Example usage
corpus = "the cat sat on the mat the dog ran in the park"
model = BigramModel()
model.train(corpus)

print(f"P(dog|the) = {model.probability('the', 'dog'):.3f}")
print(f"P(cat|the) = {model.probability('the', 'cat'):.3f}")
```

Slide 10: Evaluating ASR Systems

ASR systems are typically evaluated using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER). These metrics compare the recognized text to the ground truth transcription.

```python
def word_error_rate(reference, hypothesis):
    # Levenshtein distance implementation
    def levenshtein(s1, s2):
        if len(s1) < len(s2):
            return levenshtein(s2, s1)
        if len(s2) == 0:
            return len(s1)
        previous_row = range(len(s2) + 1)
        for i, c1 in enumerate(s1):
            current_row = [i + 1]
            for j, c2 in enumerate(s2):
                insertions = previous_row[j + 1] + 1
                deletions = current_row[j] + 1
                substitutions = previous_row[j] + (c1 != c2)
                current_row.append(min(insertions, deletions, substitutions))
            previous_row = current_row
        return previous_row[-1]

    r = reference.split()
    h = hypothesis.split()
    distance = levenshtein(r, h)
    return distance / len(r)

# Example usage
reference = "the cat sat on the mat"
hypothesis = "the cat sat on the hat"
wer = word_error_rate(reference, hypothesis)
print(f"Word Error Rate: {wer:.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Advanced HMM Techniques

Advanced techniques can further improve HMM-based ASR systems. These include context-dependent phoneme models, discriminative training, and the use of deep neural networks for acoustic modeling.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Simple DNN-HMM hybrid model
class DNNAcousticModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim),
            nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layers(x)

# Example usage
model = DNNAcousticModel(input_dim=39, hidden_dim=256, output_dim=42)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 39)
output = model(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Multilingual ASR

HMMs can be adapted for multilingual ASR by training models on multiple languages and using language identification as a preprocessing step.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

# Simplified language identification using GMMs
class LanguageIdentifier:
    def __init__(self, languages):
        self.languages = languages
        self.models = {lang: GaussianMixture(n_components=5) for lang in languages}

    def train(self, data):
        for lang, features in data.items():
            self.models[lang].fit(features)

    def identify(self, features):
        scores = {lang: model.score(features) for lang, model in self.models.items()}
        return max(scores, key=scores.get)

# Example usage
languages = ["english", "spanish", "french"]
identifier = LanguageIdentifier(languages)

# Assume we have training data for each language
training_data = {lang: np.random.randn(1000, 13) for lang in languages}
identifier.train(training_data)

# Test on new data
test_features = np.random.randn(1, 13)
identified_language = identifier.identify(test_features)
print(f"Identified language: {identified_language}")
```

Slide 13: Future Directions in ASR

While HMMs have been fundamental in ASR development, recent advancements in deep learning have led to end-to-end neural models that can outperform traditional HMM-based systems. These include architectures like Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Transformer-based models.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCTCModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True, bidirectional=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        rnn_out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        return self.fc(rnn_out)

# Example usage
model = SimpleCTCModel(input_dim=39, hidden_dim=128, output_dim=29)  # 29 for 26 letters + blank + space + apostrophe
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 100, 39)  # Batch size 1, 100 time steps, 39 features
output = model(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```
