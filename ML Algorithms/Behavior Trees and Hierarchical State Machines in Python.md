## Behavior Trees and Hierarchical State Machines in Python

Slide 1: Introduction Behavior 

Trees and Hierarchical State Machines In this slideshow, we'll explore two powerful techniques for modeling and implementing complex behaviors in Python: Behavior Trees (BTs) and Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs).

Slide 2: What are Behavior Trees? Behavior Trees (BTs) Behavior Trees are a way to model and control the behavior of an agent or system. They are tree-like structures composed of nodes that represent different tasks or conditions. Code:

```python
# A simple Behavior Tree node
class NodeBase:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []

    def add_child(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)

    def tick(self):
        raise NotImplementedError()

# Example usage
root = NodeBase("Root")
sequence = NodeBase("Sequence")
action1 = NodeBase("Action1")
action2 = NodeBase("Action2")

root.add_child(sequence)
sequence.add_child(action1)
sequence.add_child(action2)

# Traverse the Behavior Tree
def traverse(node):
    print(f"Executing node: {node.name}")
    status = node.tick()
    print(f"Node {node.name} returned status: {status}")
    for child in node.children:
        traverse(child)

traverse(root)
```

Slide 3: Behavior Tree Nodes Behavior Tree Nodes Behavior Trees consist of different types of nodes, such as:

* Sequence: Executes child nodes in order until one fails.
* Selector: Executes child nodes in order until one succeeds.
* Decorator: Modifies the behavior of its child node.
* Action: Performs a specific task.
* Condition: Evaluates a condition and returns success or failure. Code:

```python
from enum import Enum

class NodeStatus(Enum):
    SUCCESS = 1
    FAILURE = 2
    RUNNING = 3

class SequenceNode(NodeBase):
    def tick(self):
        for child in self.children:
            status = child.tick()
            if status == NodeStatus.FAILURE:
                return NodeStatus.FAILURE
            elif status == NodeStatus.RUNNING:
                return NodeStatus.RUNNING
        return NodeStatus.SUCCESS

class SelectorNode(NodeBase):
    def tick(self):
        for child in self.children:
            status = child.tick()
            if status == NodeStatus.SUCCESS:
                return NodeStatus.SUCCESS
            elif status == NodeStatus.RUNNING:
                return NodeStatus.RUNNING
        return NodeStatus.FAILURE

class ActionNode(NodeBase):
    def tick(self):
        # Perform the action
        return NodeStatus.SUCCESS

class ConditionNode(NodeBase):
    def tick(self):
        # Evaluate the condition
        return NodeStatus.SUCCESS if condition_met else NodeStatus.FAILURE
```

Slide 4: Behavior Tree Example Behavior Tree Example Let's implement a Behavior Tree for a character in a game that needs to navigate to a target location while avoiding enemies. Code:

```python
class MoveToLocation(ActionNode):
    def __init__(self, character, target_location):
        super().__init__("Move to Location")
        self.character = character
        self.target_location = target_location

    def tick(self):
        # Move the character towards the target location
        moved = self.character.move_towards(self.target_location)
        if self.character.position == self.target_location:
            return NodeStatus.SUCCESS
        elif moved:
            return NodeStatus.RUNNING
        else:
            return NodeStatus.FAILURE

class IsEnemyNear(ConditionNode):
    def __init__(self, character, danger_radius):
        super().__init__("Is Enemy Near")
        self.character = character
        self.danger_radius = danger_radius

    def tick(self):
        # Check if an enemy is nearby
        for enemy in self.character.world.enemies:
            if self.character.distance_to(enemy) < self.danger_radius:
                return NodeStatus.SUCCESS
        return NodeStatus.FAILURE

class FleeFromEnemies(ActionNode):
    def __init__(self, character):
        super().__init__("Flee From Enemies")
        self.character = character

    def tick(self):
        # Flee from nearby enemies
        safe_location = self.character.find_safe_location()
        if safe_location:
            self.character.move_towards(safe_location)
            return NodeStatus.RUNNING
        else:
            return NodeStatus.FAILURE

# Build the Behavior Tree
root = SelectorNode("Root")
flee_sequence = SequenceNode("Flee Sequence")
flee_sequence.add_child(IsEnemyNear(character, 10.0))
flee_sequence.add_child(FleeFromEnemies(character))
root.add_child(flee_sequence)
root.add_child(MoveToLocation(character, target_location))

# Run the Behavior Tree
status = root.tick()
```

Slide 5: What are Hierarchical State Machines?

Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) Hierarchical State Machines are a way to model and control the behavior of a system using a hierarchy of states and transitions between them. Code:

```python
class State:
    def enter(self):
        pass

    def execute(self):
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def exit(self):
        pass
```

Slide 6: HSM States HSM States 

In an HSM, the system can be in different states, each representing a specific behavior or condition. States can have substates, forming a hierarchy. Code:

```python
class IdleState(State):
    def execute(self):
        # Perform idle behavior

class WalkState(State):
    def execute(self):
        # Perform walking behavior
```

Slide 7: HSM Transitions HSM Transitions Transitions define the conditions under which the system moves from one state to another. Code:

```python
class Transition:
    def __init__(self, source_state, target_state, condition):
        self.source_state = source_state
        self.target_state = target_state
        self.condition = condition

    def is_triggered(self, context):
        return self.condition(context)

# Example usage
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.health = 100
        self.is_moving = False

def is_low_health(character):
    return character.health < 20

idle_state = State("Idle")
combat_state = State("Combat")

transition1 = Transition(idle_state, combat_state, is_low_health)

current_state = idle_state
context = Character()

# Trigger the transition
context.health = 10
if transition1.is_triggered(context):
    current_state = transition1.target_state
    print(f"Transitioned to {current_state.name} state")
```

Slide 8: HSM Example HSM Example Let's implement a Hierarchical State Machine for a character in a game that can transition between idle, walking, and running states based on user input. Code:

```python
class State:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.transitions = []

    def add_transition(self, transition):
        self.transitions.append(transition)

    def enter(self, character):
        pass

    def execute(self, character):
        raise NotImplementedError()

    def exit(self, character):
        pass

class IdleState(State):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Idle")

    def execute(self, character):
        # Perform idle behavior
        character.stop_moving()

class WalkState(State):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Walk")

    def execute(self, character):
        # Perform walking behavior
        character.walk()

class RunState(State):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Run")

    def execute(self, character):
        # Perform running behavior
        character.run()

class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = IdleState()
        self.input = UserInput()

        # Define transitions
        idle_to_walk = Transition(self.state, WalkState(), lambda c: c.input.is_moving)
        walk_to_run = Transition(WalkState(), RunState(), lambda c: c.input.is_running)
        run_to_walk = Transition(RunState(), WalkState(), lambda c: not c.input.is_running)
        walk_to_idle = Transition(WalkState(), IdleState(), lambda c: not c.input.is_moving)

        self.state.add_transition(idle_to_walk)
        WalkState().add_transition(walk_to_run)
        RunState().add_transition(run_to_walk)
        WalkState().add_transition(walk_to_idle)

    def update(self):
        self.state.execute(self)
        for transition in self.state.transitions:
            if transition.is_
```

Slide 9: Comparison of BTs and HSMs Comparison of BTs and HSMs Both Behavior Trees and Hierarchical State Machines are powerful techniques for modeling and implementing complex behaviors, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

Slide 10: BTs vs. HSMs: Modularity Modularity Behavior Trees are more modular and easier to extend, as new behaviors can be added by creating new nodes and plugging them into the tree. HSMs can also be modular, but it's more challenging to manage a large number of states and transitions.

Slide 11: BTs vs. HSMs: Decision Making Decision Making Behavior Trees are better suited for decision-making processes, as they can easily handle complex conditional logic and prioritization of tasks. HSMs are more appropriate for modeling sequential or state-based behaviors.

Slide 12: BTs vs. HSMs: Parallel Execution Parallel Execution Behavior Trees can naturally handle parallel execution of tasks, while HSMs typically require additional mechanisms or workarounds to achieve this.

Slide 13: BTs vs. HSMs: Memory Management Memory Management HSMs can be more memory-efficient than Behavior Trees, as they only need to maintain the current state and transitions, while Behavior Trees may require storing the state of each node in the tree.

Slide 14: When to Use BTs or HSMs When to Use BTs or HSMs In general, Behavior Trees are better suited for decision-making, task prioritization, and parallel execution, while Hierarchical State Machines are more appropriate for modeling sequential or state-based behaviors. However, the choice depends on the specific requirements of your project.
