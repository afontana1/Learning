## Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining
Slide 1: Apriori Algorithm Overview

The Apriori algorithm is a seminal technique for discovering frequent itemsets and generating association rules in transactional databases. It employs a "bottom-up" approach where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time while pruning candidates using the downward closure property.

```python
def find_frequent_1_itemsets(transactions, min_support):
    item_counts = {}
    n_transactions = len(transactions)
    
    # Count occurrences of each item
    for transaction in transactions:
        for item in transaction:
            item_counts[item] = item_counts.get(item, 0) + 1
    
    # Filter by minimum support
    frequent_items = {frozenset([item]): count 
                     for item, count in item_counts.items()
                     if count/n_transactions >= min_support}
    
    return frequent_items
```

Slide 2: Mathematical Foundation

The mathematical basis of Apriori involves support and confidence metrics for evaluating association rules. These metrics help determine the strength and reliability of discovered patterns in the dataset.

```python
# Support formula
'''
$$support(X) = \frac{frequency(X)}{total\_transactions}$$

# Confidence formula 
$$confidence(X \rightarrow Y) = \frac{support(X \cup Y)}{support(X)}$$

# Lift formula
$$lift(X \rightarrow Y) = \frac{confidence(X \rightarrow Y)}{support(Y)}$$
'''
```

Slide 3: Candidate Generation

The candidate generation process involves creating potential itemsets by combining previous frequent itemsets. This step employs the apriori property which states that all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.

```python
def generate_candidates(prev_frequent, k):
    candidates = set()
    for itemset1 in prev_frequent:
        for itemset2 in prev_frequent:
            union = itemset1.union(itemset2)
            if len(union) == k:
                # Check if all subsets are frequent
                is_valid = all(
                    frozenset(subset) in prev_frequent 
                    for subset in combinations(union, k-1)
                )
                if is_valid:
                    candidates.add(union)
    return candidates
```

Slide 4: Support Counting Implementation

Support counting is a critical step that determines which candidate itemsets meet the minimum support threshold. This implementation efficiently tracks itemset frequencies across the transaction database.

```python
def count_support(transactions, candidates):
    support_count = defaultdict(int)
    for transaction in transactions:
        transaction_set = set(transaction)
        for candidate in candidates:
            if candidate.issubset(transaction_set):
                support_count[candidate] += 1
    return support_count
```

Slide 5: Complete Apriori Implementation

The complete implementation combines candidate generation, support counting, and frequent itemset discovery in an iterative process that continues until no new frequent itemsets are found.

```python
def apriori(transactions, min_support):
    # Initial frequent 1-itemsets
    frequent = find_frequent_1_itemsets(transactions, min_support)
    all_frequent = dict(frequent)
    k = 2
    
    while frequent:
        candidates = generate_candidates(frequent.keys(), k)
        support_counts = count_support(transactions, candidates)
        
        # Filter by minimum support
        n_transactions = len(transactions)
        frequent = {itemset: count for itemset, count in support_counts.items()
                   if count/n_transactions >= min_support}
        
        all_frequent.update(frequent)
        k += 1
        
    return all_frequent
```

Slide 6: Rule Generation

Association rule generation is performed after finding frequent itemsets. The process creates rules by partitioning each frequent itemset into antecedent and consequent, then evaluating their confidence and lift metrics.

```python
def generate_rules(frequent_itemsets, min_confidence):
    rules = []
    for itemset, support in frequent_itemsets.items():
        if len(itemset) > 1:
            for i in range(1, len(itemset)):
                for antecedent in combinations(itemset, i):
                    antecedent = frozenset(antecedent)
                    consequent = itemset - antecedent
                    confidence = support / frequent_itemsets[antecedent]
                    if confidence >= min_confidence:
                        rules.append((antecedent, consequent, confidence))
    return rules
```

Slide 7: Market Basket Analysis Example

A practical implementation of market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm to discover purchasing patterns in retail transaction data. This example demonstrates data preprocessing and pattern discovery.

```python
# Sample transaction data
transactions = [
    ['bread', 'milk', 'eggs'],
    ['bread', 'butter', 'cheese'],
    ['milk', 'butter', 'eggs'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'butter', 'eggs'],
    ['bread', 'milk', 'butter']
]

# Run Apriori algorithm
min_support = 0.3
frequent_itemsets = apriori(transactions, min_support)

# Generate association rules
min_confidence = 0.7
rules = generate_rules(frequent_itemsets, min_confidence)

# Print discovered rules
for antecedent, consequent, confidence in rules:
    print(f"{set(antecedent)} -> {set(consequent)} (conf: {confidence:.2f})")
```

Slide 8: Performance Optimization

Performance optimization techniques for the Apriori algorithm focus on reducing the computational overhead of candidate generation and support counting through efficient data structures and pruning strategies.

```python
def optimized_support_count(transactions, candidates):
    # Use bit vectors for faster subset checking
    transaction_bits = []
    item_to_index = {item: idx for idx, item in enumerate(set.union(*candidates))}
    
    for transaction in transactions:
        bits = [0] * len(item_to_index)
        for item in transaction:
            if item in item_to_index:
                bits[item_to_index[item]] = 1
        transaction_bits.append(bits)
    
    support_count = defaultdict(int)
    for candidate in candidates:
        candidate_indices = [item_to_index[item] for item in candidate]
        for trans_bits in transaction_bits:
            if all(trans_bits[idx] for idx in candidate_indices):
                support_count[candidate] += 1
                
    return support_count
```

Slide 9: E-commerce Product Recommendations

Implementation of a product recommendation system using the Apriori algorithm to analyze customer purchase history and suggest complementary products.

```python
def recommend_products(user_basket, rules, top_n=5):
    recommendations = []
    for antecedent, consequent, confidence in rules:
        if antecedent.issubset(user_basket):
            for item in consequent:
                if item not in user_basket:
                    recommendations.append((item, confidence))
    
    # Sort by confidence and return top N recommendations
    recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return recommendations[:top_n]

# Example usage
user_basket = {'bread', 'milk'}
recommendations = recommend_products(user_basket, rules)
print("Recommended products:", recommendations)
```

Slide 10: Memory Efficient Implementation

Memory optimization for handling large transaction databases by implementing a sliding window approach and incremental support counting mechanism.

```python
def memory_efficient_apriori(transaction_iterator, min_support, batch_size=1000):
    frequent_items = defaultdict(int)
    total_transactions = 0
    
    # Process transactions in batches
    for batch in iter(lambda: list(islice(transaction_iterator, batch_size)), []):
        total_transactions += len(batch)
        
        # Update support counts for current batch
        batch_counts = count_support(batch, frequent_items.keys())
        for itemset, count in batch_counts.items():
            frequent_items[itemset] += count
        
        # Prune infrequent itemsets
        min_count = min_support * total_transactions
        frequent_items = {k: v for k, v in frequent_items.items() 
                        if v >= min_count}
    
    return frequent_items
```

Slide 11: Results Analysis and Visualization

Implementation of visualization tools to analyze and interpret the discovered association rules, including support-confidence plots and network graphs of item relationships.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle

def visualize_rules(rules, min_confidence=0.5, min_lift=1.0):
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    for antecedent, consequent, metrics in rules:
        if metrics['confidence'] >= min_confidence and metrics['lift'] >= min_lift:
            ant_str = ','.join(sorted(antecedent))
            cons_str = ','.join(sorted(consequent))
            G.add_edge(ant_str, cons_str, 
                      weight=metrics['confidence'],
                      lift=metrics['lift'])
    
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', 
            node_size=2000, arrowsize=20, font_size=10)
    plt.title("Association Rules Network")
    return plt
```

Slide 12: Real-time Transaction Processing

Implementation of a streaming version of the Apriori algorithm that can process transactions in real-time and update association rules dynamically.

```python
class StreamingApriori:
    def __init__(self, min_support, min_confidence, window_size=1000):
        self.min_support = min_support
        self.min_confidence = min_confidence
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.transaction_window = []
        self.frequent_itemsets = {}
        self.rules = []
    
    def process_transaction(self, transaction):
        # Add new transaction and maintain window size
        self.transaction_window.append(transaction)
        if len(self.transaction_window) > self.window_size:
            self.transaction_window.pop(0)
            
        # Update frequent itemsets and rules
        if len(self.transaction_window) % 100 == 0:  # Update periodically
            self.frequent_itemsets = apriori(
                self.transaction_window, 
                self.min_support
            )
            self.rules = generate_rules(
                self.frequent_itemsets, 
                self.min_confidence
            )
            
        return self.rules
```

Slide 13: Performance Metrics and Evaluation

Implementation of comprehensive evaluation metrics for assessing the quality and usefulness of discovered association rules.

```python
def evaluate_rules(rules, test_transactions):
    metrics = {}
    for antecedent, consequent, confidence in rules:
        support_antecedent = 0
        support_both = 0
        total_transactions = len(test_transactions)
        
        for transaction in test_transactions:
            if antecedent.issubset(transaction):
                support_antecedent += 1
                if consequent.issubset(transaction):
                    support_both += 1
        
        # Calculate metrics
        actual_confidence = (support_both / support_antecedent 
                           if support_antecedent > 0 else 0)
        support = support_both / total_transactions
        lift = (actual_confidence / (support / total_transactions) 
               if support > 0 else 0)
        
        metrics[(antecedent, consequent)] = {
            'predicted_confidence': confidence,
            'actual_confidence': actual_confidence,
            'support': support,

        }
    
    return metrics
```
