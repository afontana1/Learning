## Boosting Machine Learning Efficiency with Vectorization
Slide 1: Introduction to Vectorization in Machine Learning

Vectorization is a powerful technique in machine learning that transforms operations on individual data elements into operations on entire arrays or vectors. This approach significantly improves computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging libraries like NumPy, we can perform complex calculations on entire datasets simultaneously, reducing execution time and simplifying code.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Non-vectorized approach
def dot_product_loop(a, b):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += a[i] * b[i]
    return result

# Vectorized approach
def dot_product_vectorized(a, b):
    return np.dot(a, b)

# Compare performance
a = np.random.rand(1000000)
b = np.random.rand(1000000)

start = time.time()
result_loop = dot_product_loop(a, b)
end = time.time()
print(f"Loop method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")

start = time.time()
result_vectorized = dot_product_vectorized(a, b)
end = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

Slide 2: The Basics of Vectorization

Vectorization allows us to perform operations on entire arrays at once, rather than iterating through individual elements. This approach not only speeds up computations but also leads to cleaner, more readable code. Let's compare a simple operation using both a loop-based approach and a vectorized approach.

```python
import numpy as np

# Data
numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Non-vectorized approach
squared_loop = []
for num in numbers:
    squared_loop.append(num ** 2)

# Vectorized approach
squared_vectorized = numbers ** 2

print("Loop result:", squared_loop)
print("Vectorized result:", squared_vectorized)
```

Slide 3: Vectorization in Matrix Operations

Matrix operations are a prime example where vectorization shines. Let's compare matrix multiplication using a loop-based approach and a vectorized approach using NumPy.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Create two 100x100 matrices
A = np.random.rand(100, 100)
B = np.random.rand(100, 100)

# Non-vectorized approach
def matrix_multiply_loop(A, B):
    result = np.zeros((A.shape[0], B.shape[1]))
    for i in range(A.shape[0]):
        for j in range(B.shape[1]):
            for k in range(A.shape[1]):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return result

# Vectorized approach
def matrix_multiply_vectorized(A, B):
    return np.dot(A, B)

# Compare performance
start = time.time()
result_loop = matrix_multiply_loop(A, B)
end = time.time()
print(f"Loop method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")

start = time.time()
result_vectorized = matrix_multiply_vectorized(A, B)
end = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

Slide 4: Vectorization in Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. Let's implement min-max scaling using both loop-based and vectorized approaches.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = np.array([1, 5, 3, 8, 10, 2, 7, 6])

# Non-vectorized approach
def min_max_scale_loop(data):
    min_val = min(data)
    max_val = max(data)
    scaled = []
    for x in data:
        scaled.append((x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val))
    return scaled

# Vectorized approach
def min_max_scale_vectorized(data):
    return (data - np.min(data)) / (np.max(data) - np.min(data))

print("Loop result:", min_max_scale_loop(data))
print("Vectorized result:", min_max_scale_vectorized(data))
```

Slide 5: Vectorization in Statistical Calculations

Statistical calculations often involve operations on entire datasets. Vectorization can significantly speed up these computations. Let's compare calculating the mean and standard deviation using loop-based and vectorized approaches.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

# Generate a large dataset
data = np.random.rand(1000000)

# Non-vectorized approach
def stats_loop(data):
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    var = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)
    std = var ** 0.5
    return mean, std

# Vectorized approach
def stats_vectorized(data):
    return np.mean(data), np.std(data)

# Compare performance
start = time.time()
mean_loop, std_loop = stats_loop(data)
end = time.time()
print(f"Loop method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")

start = time.time()
mean_vec, std_vec = stats_vectorized(data)
end = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

Slide 6: Vectorization in Image Processing

Image processing is another area where vectorization can greatly improve performance. Let's implement a simple image blurring operation using both loop-based and vectorized approaches.

# Load an image
image = np.array(Image.open('sample_image.jpg').convert('L'))

# Non-vectorized approach
def blur_loop(image, kernel_size=3):
    h, w = image.shape
    blurred = np.zeros((h, w))
    for i in range(1, h-1):
        for j in range(1, w-1):
            blurred[i, j] = np.mean(image[i-1:i+2, j-1:j+2])
    return blurred

# Vectorized approach
def blur_vectorized(image, kernel_size=3):
    kernel = np.ones((kernel_size, kernel_size)) / (kernel_size ** 2)
    return np.convolve(image, kernel, mode='same')

# Compare performance
start = time.time()
blurred_loop = blur_loop(image)
end = time.time()
print(f"Loop method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")

start = time.time()
blurred_vectorized = blur_vectorized(image)
end = time.time()
print(f"Vectorized method: {end - start:.6f} seconds")
```

import time

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 1)
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(1000, 1) * 0.1

# Non-vectorized approach
def gradient_descent_loop(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m, n = X.shape
    theta = np.zeros((n, 1))
    for _ in range(iterations):
        h = np.zeros((m, 1))
        for i in range(m):
            h[i] = np.sum(X[i] * theta)
        gradient = np.zeros((n, 1))
        for j in range(n):
            for i in range(m):
                gradient[j] += (h[i] - y[i]) * X[i, j]
        gradient /= m
        theta -= learning_rate * gradient
    return theta

# Vectorized approach
def gradient_descent_vectorized(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m, n = X.shape
    theta = np.zeros((n, 1))
    for _ in range(iterations):
        h = X.dot(theta)
        gradient = (1/m) * X.T.dot(h - y)
        theta -= learning_rate * gradient
    return theta

# Compare performance

# Non-vectorized approach
def forward_pass_loop(X, W1, W2):
    hidden = np.zeros((X.shape[0], W1.shape[1]))
    for i in range(X.shape[0]):
        for j in range(W1.shape[1]):
            hidden[i, j] = np.sum(X[i] * W1[:, j])
    hidden = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-hidden))  # Sigmoid activation
    
    output = np.zeros((hidden.shape[0], W2.shape[1]))
    for i in range(hidden.shape[0]):
        for j in range(W2.shape[1]):
            output[i, j] = np.sum(hidden[i] * W2[:, j])

    idf = {}
    for word in word_set:
        idf[word] = sum(1 for doc in documents if word in doc.split())
    idf = {word: np.log(len(documents) / count) for word, count in idf.items()}
    
    tfidf = []
