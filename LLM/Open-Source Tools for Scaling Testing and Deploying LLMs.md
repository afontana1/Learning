## Open-Source Tools for Scaling Testing and Deploying LLMs
Slide 1: Introduction to Open-Source LLM Tools

The development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) require a robust set of tools for scaling, testing, deployment, and monitoring. This presentation explores various open-source tools designed to handle different stages of LLM projects. We'll cover libraries for scaling model training, frameworks for testing and evaluation, deployment solutions, and logging tools.

```python
# Example: Simple demonstration of model size calculation
def calculate_model_size(num_parameters, precision_bits):
    size_in_bits = num_parameters * precision_bits
    size_in_gb = size_in_bits / (8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
    return size_in_gb

# GPT-2 XL parameters and precision
gpt2_xl_params = 1.5e9  # 1.5 billion parameters
precision = 16  # 16-bit precision

model_size = calculate_model_size(gpt2_xl_params, precision)
print(f"GPT-2 XL model size: {model_size:.2f} GB")
```

Slide 2: Scaling Challenges in LLM Training

Training LLMs presents significant challenges due to their immense size. For instance, GPT-2 XL, with 1.5 billion parameters, requires approximately 3GB of memory in 16-bit precision. This makes it difficult to train on a single GPU, even with 30GB of memory. The field of LLM development is thus heavily focused on engineering solutions to overcome these scaling challenges.

Slide 3: Source Code for Scaling Challenges in LLM Training

```python
import math

def estimate_gpu_requirements(model_size_gb, batch_size, gpu_memory_gb):
    # Assume 2x memory needed for optimizer states and gradients
    total_memory_needed = model_size_gb * 2 * batch_size
    num_gpus_needed = math.ceil(total_memory_needed / gpu_memory_gb)
    return num_gpus_needed

# Example: GPT-2 XL
model_size_gb = 3  # 3GB for GPT-2 XL
batch_size = 32
gpu_memory_gb = 30  # 30GB GPU

num_gpus = estimate_gpu_requirements(model_size_gb, batch_size, gpu_memory_gb)
print(f"Estimated number of 30GB GPUs needed: {num_gpus}")
```

Slide 4: DeepSpeed for Model Parallelism

DeepSpeed is a deep learning optimization library that enables distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes. It implements various parallelism techniques, including model parallelism, which allows splitting large models across multiple GPUs.

Slide 5: Source Code for DeepSpeed for Model Parallelism

```python
# Note: This is a simplified example. In practice, you'd use the DeepSpeed library.
import torch

class SimpleModelParallel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_gpus):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_gpus = num_gpus
        self.layers = torch.nn.ModuleList([
            torch.nn.Linear(1000, 1000).to(f'cuda:{i}')
            for i in range(num_gpus)
        ])

    def forward(self, x):
        for i, layer in enumerate(self.layers):
            x = x.to(f'cuda:{i}')
            x = layer(x)
        return x

model = SimpleModelParallel(num_gpus=4)
print("Model distributed across 4 GPUs")
```

Slide 6: Megatron-LM for Tensor Parallelism

Megatron-LM is another framework for training large language models. It implements tensor parallelism, which splits individual layers across multiple GPUs, allowing for efficient training of very large models.

Slide 7: Source Code for Megatron-LM for Tensor Parallelism

```python
# Note: This is a simplified representation of tensor parallelism
import torch

class TensorParallelLinear(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, num_gpus):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_gpus = num_gpus
        self.split_size = out_features // num_gpus
        self.linears = torch.nn.ModuleList([
            torch.nn.Linear(in_features, self.split_size).to(f'cuda:{i}')
            for i in range(num_gpus)
        ])

    def forward(self, x):
        splits = [linear(x.to(linear.weight.device)) for linear in self.linears]
        return torch.cat(splits, dim=-1)

tp_linear = TensorParallelLinear(1000, 4000, num_gpus=4)
print("Tensor Parallel Linear layer created across 4 GPUs")
```

Slide 8: Evaluation with lm-evaluation-harness

The lm-evaluation-harness is a framework for evaluating language models on various benchmarks. It provides a standardized way to assess model performance across different tasks and datasets.

Slide 9: Source Code for Evaluation with lm-evaluation-harness

```python
# Note: This is a simplified example. Actual usage would involve the lm-evaluation-harness library.
def evaluate_model(model, task, dataset):
    total_score = 0
    for example in dataset:
        prediction = model.generate(example['input'])
        score = task.score(prediction, example['target'])
        total_score += score
    return total_score / len(dataset)

class DummyModel:
    def generate(self, input_text):
        return "This is a dummy prediction."

class SentimentTask:
    def score(self, prediction, target):
        return 1 if prediction == target else 0

model = DummyModel()
task = SentimentTask()
dataset = [
    {'input': 'Great movie!', 'target': 'positive'},
    {'input': 'Terrible experience.', 'target': 'negative'}
]

score = evaluate_model(model, task, dataset)
print(f"Model evaluation score: {score}")
```

Slide 10: Serving LLMs with vLLM

vLLM is a high-throughput serving engine for LLMs. It implements efficient memory management and batching strategies to maximize GPU utilization and minimize latency.

Slide 11: Source Code for Serving LLMs with vLLM

```python
# Note: This is a simplified representation. Actual usage would involve the vLLM library.
import asyncio

class MockvLLM:
    async def generate(self, prompt, max_tokens=100):
        # Simulate some processing time
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        return f"Generated response for: {prompt}"

async def serve_requests(llm, requests):
    tasks = [llm.generate(req) for req in requests]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return responses

async def main():
    llm = MockvLLM()
    requests = [
        "Tell me about AI",
        "Explain quantum computing",
        "What is the capital of France?"
    ]
    responses = await serve_requests(llm, requests)
    for req, res in zip(requests, responses):
        print(f"Request: {req}\nResponse: {res}\n")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Slide 12: Logging with MLflow

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

Slide 13: Source Code for Logging with MLflow

```python
# Note: This is a simplified example. Actual usage would involve the MLflow library.
import random
from datetime import datetime

class MockMLflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.runs = {}

    def start_run(self):
        run_id = f"run_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
        self.runs[run_id] = {"params": {}, "metrics": {}}
        return run_id

    def log_param(self, run_id, key, value):
        self.runs[run_id]["params"][key] = value

    def log_metric(self, run_id, key, value):
        self.runs[run_id]["metrics"][key] = value

# Usage example
mlflow = MockMLflow()

def train_model(learning_rate, num_epochs):
    run_id = mlflow.start_run()
    mlflow.log_param(run_id, "learning_rate", learning_rate)
    mlflow.log_param(run_id, "num_epochs", num_epochs)
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        accuracy = random.random()  # Simulated accuracy
        mlflow.log_metric(run_id, f"accuracy_epoch_{epoch}", accuracy)
    
    return run_id

run_id = train_model(0.01, 5)
print(f"Training completed. Run ID: {run_id}")
print(f"Logged data: {mlflow.runs[run_id]}")
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

Let's create a simple sentiment analysis pipeline that demonstrates scaling, evaluation, and logging. We'll use mock implementations to represent the actual libraries.

Slide 15: Source Code for Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

```python
import random

class MockDeepSpeed:
    def zero_optimizer(self, model):
        print("DeepSpeed: Optimizing model with ZeRO")

class MockEvaluationHarness:
    def evaluate(self, model, dataset):
        print("Evaluation Harness: Evaluating model")
        return random.uniform(0.7, 0.9)

class MockMLflow:
    def log_metric(self, metric_name, value):
        print(f"MLflow: Logging metric {metric_name} = {value}")

class SentimentModel:
    def train(self, dataset):
        print("Training sentiment analysis model")

# Sentiment analysis pipeline
def sentiment_analysis_pipeline():
    model = SentimentModel()
    dataset = ["This is great!", "I'm feeling sad", "Neutral statement"]
    
    # Scaling
    deepspeed = MockDeepSpeed()
    deepspeed.zero_optimizer(model)
    
    # Training
    model.train(dataset)
    
    # Evaluation
    evaluator = MockEvaluationHarness()
    accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(model, dataset)
    
    # Logging
    mlflow = MockMLflow()
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

    print(f"Pipeline completed. Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

sentiment_analysis_pipeline()
```

Slide 16: Real-Life Example: Distributed Text Generation

In this example, we'll simulate a distributed text generation system using multiple GPUs. This demonstrates scaling, deployment, and basic logging concepts.

Slide 17: Source Code for Distributed Text Generation

```python
import random
import time

class MockGPU:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

    def generate_text(self, prompt):
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.5))  # Simulate processing time
        return f"Generated text from GPU {self.id}: {prompt}..."

class DistributedTextGenerator:
    def __init__(self, num_gpus):
        self.gpus = [MockGPU(i) for i in range(num_gpus)]

    def generate(self, prompts):
        results = []
        for i, prompt in enumerate(prompts):
            gpu = self.gpus[i % len(self.gpus)]
            result = gpu.generate_text(prompt)
            results.append(result)
        return results

def log_generation(prompt, result):
    print(f"Log: Generated text for prompt '{prompt}': {result[:30]}...")

# Usage
generator = DistributedTextGenerator(num_gpus=4)
prompts = [
    "Once upon a time",
    "In a galaxy far, far away",
    "It was a dark and stormy night",
    "The quick brown fox",
    "To be or not to be",
    "In the beginning"
]

results = generator.generate(prompts)

for prompt, result in zip(prompts, results):
    log_generation(prompt, result)

print(f"Generated {len(results)} texts using {len(generator.gpus)} GPUs")
```
