## AI Models Struggle with Self-Generated Data
Slide 1: Understanding Model Collapse

Model collapse is a phenomenon where AI systems trained on data generated by previous model generations experience a decline in performance. This issue arises when AI models learn from artificial data rather than real-world information, leading to a progressive deterioration in their capabilities.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

def simulate_model_collapse(generations, initial_perplexity):
    perplexities = [initial_perplexity]
    for _ in range(1, generations):
        perplexity = perplexities[-1] * (1 + random.uniform(0.05, 0.15))
        perplexities.append(perplexity)
    return perplexities

generations = 10
initial_perplexity = 10

perplexities = simulate_model_collapse(generations, initial_perplexity)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, generations + 1), perplexities, marker='o')
plt.title('Simulated Model Collapse')
plt.xlabel('Model Generation')
plt.ylabel('Perplexity (lower is better)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Perplexity and Model Performance

Perplexity is a measure of how well a language model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates better performance. In the context of model collapse, we observe increasing perplexity scores across generations, signifying deteriorating model quality.

```python
def calculate_perplexity(probabilities):
    return 2 ** (-sum(map(lambda p: p * math.log2(p), probabilities)) / len(probabilities))

# Example probabilities for a language model's predictions
probabilities = [0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.4, 0.25]

perplexity = calculate_perplexity(probabilities)
print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity:.2f}")
```

Slide 3: Variability in Later Generations

As model collapse progresses, later generations of AI models exhibit more varied perplexity scores. This increased variability suggests growing instability and unpredictability in model performance.

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_varied_perplexity(generations, initial_perplexity, variance_increase_rate):
    perplexities = []
    variance = 0.1
    for gen in range(generations):
        perplexity = np.random.normal(initial_perplexity * (1 + 0.1 * gen), variance)
        perplexities.append(max(perplexity, 1))  # Ensure non-negative perplexity
        variance *= (1 + variance_increase_rate)
    return perplexities

generations = 10
initial_perplexity = 10
variance_increase_rate = 0.2

varied_perplexities = simulate_varied_perplexity(generations, initial_perplexity, variance_increase_rate)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(1, generations + 1), varied_perplexities, marker='o')
plt.title('Simulated Varied Perplexity Across Generations')
plt.xlabel('Model Generation')
plt.ylabel('Perplexity (lower is better)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Preserving Original Data

Maintaining some original, real-world data in the training process helps mitigate model collapse. This approach ensures that the model continues to learn from authentic information, reducing the risk of performance degradation.

```python
def train_model(original_data_ratio, generations):
    performance = 100  # Initial performance score
    for _ in range(generations):
        if random.random() < original_data_ratio:
            performance *= 1.05  # Slight improvement with original data
        else:
            performance *= 0.95  # Slight degradation with generated data
    return performance

original_data_ratios = [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1]
generations = 10

for ratio in original_data_ratios:
    final_performance = train_model(ratio, generations)
    print(f"Original data ratio: {ratio:.1f}, Final performance: {final_performance:.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Real-life Example: Text Generation

Let's consider a text generation task to illustrate model collapse. We'll simulate the quality of generated text across multiple generations of models.

```python
import random

def generate_text(quality):
    words = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
    text = []
    for _ in range(10):
        if random.random() < quality:
            text.append(random.choice(words))
        else:
            text.append("UNKNOWN")
    return " ".join(text)

generations = 5
initial_quality = 0.9

for gen in range(generations):
    quality = initial_quality * (0.8 ** gen)
    generated_text = generate_text(quality)
    print(f"Generation {gen + 1} (quality: {quality:.2f}): {generated_text}")
```

Slide 6: Analyzing Model Collapse

To better understand model collapse, we can analyze the relationship between the amount of generated data used in training and the resulting model performance. This analysis helps identify the tipping point where the use of generated data becomes detrimental.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def model_performance(generated_data_ratio):
    return 100 * (1 - generated_data_ratio**2)

generated_data_ratios = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
performances = [model_performance(ratio) for ratio in generated_data_ratios]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(generated_data_ratios, performances)
plt.title('Model Performance vs. Generated Data Ratio')
plt.xlabel('Ratio of Generated Data in Training')
plt.ylabel('Model Performance')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Mitigating Model Collapse

To address model collapse, researchers and practitioners can employ various strategies. One effective approach is to implement a data mixing technique, where a carefully balanced combination of original and generated data is used for training.

```python
def train_with_data_mixing(original_ratio, generations):
    performance = 100
    for _ in range(generations):
        original_contribution = original_ratio * 1.05
        generated_contribution = (1 - original_ratio) * 0.95
        performance *= (original_contribution + generated_contribution)
    return performance

original_ratios = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]
generations = 10

for ratio in original_ratios:
    final_performance = train_with_data_mixing(ratio, generations)
    print(f"Original data ratio: {ratio:.1f}, Final performance: {final_performance:.2f}")
```

Slide 8: Detecting Model Collapse

Early detection of model collapse is crucial for maintaining AI system quality. We can implement a monitoring system that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) across model generations to identify potential collapse.

```python
def detect_model_collapse(kpi_history, threshold=0.1):
    if len(kpi_history) < 3:
        return False
    
    recent_kpis = kpi_history[-3:]
    avg_decline = (recent_kpis[0] - recent_kpis[2]) / 2
    
    return avg_decline > threshold

# Simulating KPI history for multiple generations
kpi_history = [0.95, 0.93, 0.92, 0.88, 0.85, 0.79, 0.72]

for i in range(3, len(kpi_history)):
    collapse_detected = detect_model_collapse(kpi_history[:i+1])
    print(f"Generation {i+1}: Collapse detected: {collapse_detected}")
```

Slide 9: Visualizing Model Collapse

To better understand the progression of model collapse, we can create a visualization that compares the performance of models trained on original data versus those trained on generated data over multiple generations.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_performance(use_original_data, generations):
    performance = 100
    history = [performance]
    for _ in range(generations):
        if use_original_data:
            performance *= 1.01  # Slight improvement
        else:
            performance *= 0.97  # Slight degradation
        history.append(performance)
    return history

generations = 20
original_data_performance = simulate_performance(True, generations)
generated_data_performance = simulate_performance(False, generations)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(range(generations + 1), original_data_performance, label='Original Data')
plt.plot(range(generations + 1), generated_data_performance, label='Generated Data')
plt.title('Model Performance Over Generations')
plt.xlabel('Generation')
plt.ylabel('Performance')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Real-life Example: Image Classification

Consider an image classification task where we simulate the accuracy of models trained on original images versus those trained on AI-generated images across multiple generations.

```python
import random

def classify_image(model_quality):
    classes = ["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish", "rabbit"]
    if random.random() < model_quality:
        return random.choice(classes)
    else:
        return "unknown"

def evaluate_model(model_quality, num_images=1000):
    correct = sum(1 for _ in range(num_images) if classify_image(model_quality) != "unknown")
    return correct / num_images

generations = 5
original_quality = 0.95
generated_quality = 0.9

for gen in range(generations):
    original_accuracy = evaluate_model(original_quality)
    generated_accuracy = evaluate_model(generated_quality)
    
    print(f"Generation {gen + 1}:")
    print(f"  Original data model accuracy: {original_accuracy:.2%}")
    print(f"  Generated data model accuracy: {generated_accuracy:.2%}")
    
    original_quality *= 1.01
    generated_quality *= 0.95
```

Slide 11: Quantifying Information Loss

To understand the mechanism behind model collapse, we can quantify the information loss that occurs when training on generated data. This can be done by measuring the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the original data distribution and the generated data distribution.

```python
import numpy as np

def kl_divergence(p, q):
    return np.sum(np.where(p != 0, p * np.log(p / q), 0))

# Simulating probability distributions
original_dist = np.array([0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.25, 0.15])
generated_dist = np.array([0.28, 0.22, 0.12, 0.23, 0.15])

kl_div = kl_divergence(original_dist, generated_dist)
print(f"KL Divergence: {kl_div:.4f}")

# Simulating information loss over generations
generations = 5
for gen in range(generations):
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, size=generated_dist.shape)
    generated_dist += noise
    generated_dist /= generated_dist.sum()  # Normalize
    
    kl_div = kl_divergence(original_dist, generated_dist)
    print(f"Generation {gen + 1} KL Divergence: {kl_div:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Entropy and Model Collapse

Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a system. In the context of model collapse, we can observe how the entropy of generated data changes across generations, potentially indicating a loss of diversity and information.

```python
import math

def calculate_entropy(probabilities):
    return -sum(p * math.log2(p) for p in probabilities if p > 0)

# Simulating probability distributions over generations
generations = 5
initial_dist = [0.2, 0.3, 0.15, 0.25, 0.1]

for gen in range(generations):
    entropy = calculate_entropy(initial_dist)
    print(f"Generation {gen + 1} Entropy: {entropy:.4f}")
    
    # Simulate changes in distribution
    initial_dist = [p + random.uniform(-0.05, 0.05) for p in initial_dist]
    initial_dist = [max(0, p) for p in initial_dist]  # Ensure non-negative probabilities
    total = sum(initial_dist)
    initial_dist = [p / total for p in initial_dist]  # Normalize
```

Slide 13: Regularization Techniques

Regularization can help mitigate model collapse by preventing overfitting to generated data. Let's implement a simple L2 regularization technique and observe its effect on model performance.

```python
import numpy as np

def train_model(data, regularization_strength):
    # Simplified model training with regularization
    model_params = np.random.randn(5)  # Random initial parameters
    
    for _ in range(100):  # Training iterations
        # Simplified gradient update with L2 regularization
        gradient = np.random.randn(5)  # Simulated gradient
        model_params -= 0.01 * (gradient + regularization_strength * model_params)
    
    return np.sum(np.abs(model_params))  # Model complexity measure

# Simulate training with different regularization strengths
reg_strengths = [0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0]

for strength in reg_strengths:
    complexity = train_model(None, strength)
    print(f"Regularization strength: {strength}, Model complexity: {complexity:.4f}")
```

Slide 14: Future Directions and Research

As we continue to grapple with the challenges of model collapse, several promising research directions emerge. These include developing more robust data generation techniques, exploring novel architectures resistant to collapse, and investigating the theoretical foundations of this phenomenon.

```python
import random

def simulate_research_progress(years, initial_success_rate):
    success_rate = initial_success_rate
    progress = []
    
    for year in range(years):
        progress.append(success_rate)
        
        # Simulate research breakthroughs and setbacks
        if random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% chance of significant progress
            success_rate += random.uniform(0.05, 0.15)
        else:
            success_rate += random.uniform(-0.02, 0.05)
        
        success_rate = max(0, min(1, success_rate))  # Clamp between 0 and 1
    
    return progress

years = 10
initial_success_rate = 0.5

research_progress = simulate_research_progress(years, initial_success_rate)

for year, progress in enumerate(research_progress, start=1):
    print(f"Year {year}: Success rate = {progress:.2f}")
```
