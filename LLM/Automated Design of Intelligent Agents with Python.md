## Automated Design of Intelligent Agents with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Automated Design of Agentic Systems

Automated design of agentic systems refers to the process of creating intelligent agents that can make decisions and take actions autonomously. This field combines principles from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering to develop systems that can adapt and respond to their environment.

```python
import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.state = "idle"
    
    def sense(self, environment):
        # Perceive the environment
        return environment.get_state()
    
    def decide(self, perception):
        # Make a decision based on perception
        return random.choice(["move", "stay"])
    
    def act(self, decision):
        # Execute the decision
        self.state = decision
        print(f"{self.name} decided to {decision}")

# Usage
agent = Agent("AgentX")
environment_state = {"obstacles": 2, "goal_distance": 5}
perception = agent.sense(environment_state)
decision = agent.decide(perception)
agent.act(decision)
```

Slide 2: Agent Architecture

The architecture of an intelligent agent typically consists of three main components: sensing, decision-making, and acting. This structure allows the agent to perceive its environment, process information, and take appropriate actions.

```python
class AdvancedAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.state = "idle"
        self.knowledge_base = {}
    
    def sense(self, environment):
        return environment.get_state()
    
    def decide(self, perception):
        # Update knowledge base
        self.knowledge_base.update(perception)
        
        # Simple decision logic
        if self.knowledge_base.get("obstacles", 0) > 3:
            return "avoid"
        elif self.knowledge_base.get("goal_distance", 0) < 2:
            return "approach"
        else:
            return "explore"
    
    def act(self, decision):
        self.state = decision
        print(f"{self.name} decided to {decision}")

# Usage
advanced_agent = AdvancedAgent("AdvancedAgentX")
environment_state = {"obstacles": 4, "goal_distance": 3}
perception = advanced_agent.sense(environment_state)
decision = advanced_agent.decide(perception)
advanced_agent.act(decision)
```

Slide 3: Environment Modeling

Modeling the environment is crucial for automated design of agentic systems. It involves creating a digital representation of the world in which the agent operates, including objects, constraints, and dynamics.

```python
import numpy as np

class Environment:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.grid = np.zeros((size, size))
        self.agent_pos = None
        self.goal_pos = None
    
    def place_agent(self, x, y):
        self.agent_pos = (x, y)
        self.grid[x, y] = 1
    
    def place_goal(self, x, y):
        self.goal_pos = (x, y)
        self.grid[x, y] = 2
    
    def add_obstacle(self, x, y):
        self.grid[x, y] = -1
    
    def get_state(self):
        return {
            "agent_pos": self.agent_pos,
            "goal_pos": self.goal_pos,
            "obstacles": np.where(self.grid == -1)
        }

# Create and setup environment
env = Environment(10)
env.place_agent(0, 0)
env.place_goal(9, 9)
env.add_obstacle(5, 5)
print(env.grid)
```

Slide 4: Decision-Making Algorithms

Decision-making algorithms are at the core of agentic systems. These algorithms enable agents to choose actions based on their current state and goals. Common approaches include rule-based systems, decision trees, and reinforcement learning.

```python
import random

class DecisionMaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules = {
            "near_obstacle": lambda state: "avoid" if state["nearest_obstacle_distance"] < 2 else None,
            "near_goal": lambda state: "approach" if state["goal_distance"] < 3 else None,
            "default": lambda state: random.choice(["move_left", "move_right", "move_up", "move_down"])
        }
    
    def make_decision(self, state):
        for rule, action in self.rules.items():
            decision = action(state)
            if decision:
                return decision
        return self.rules["default"](state)

# Usage
decision_maker = DecisionMaker()
state = {"nearest_obstacle_distance": 1, "goal_distance": 5}
decision = decision_maker.make_decision(state)
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
```

Slide 5: Reinforcement Learning for Agents

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful technique for training agents to make optimal decisions. In RL, agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on their actions.

```python
import numpy as np

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, states, actions, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.9, epsilon=0.1):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((states, actions))
        self.alpha = alpha  # Learning rate
        self.gamma = gamma  # Discount factor
        self.epsilon = epsilon  # Exploration rate
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(self.q_table.shape[1])  # Explore
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state, :])  # Exploit
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        predict = self.q_table[state, action]
        target = reward + self.gamma * np.max(self.q_table[next_state, :])
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.alpha * (target - predict)

# Usage
agent = QLearningAgent(states=10, actions=4)
state = 0
action = agent.choose_action(state)
next_state = 1
reward = 1
agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state)
print(agent.q_table)
```

Slide 6: Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems involve multiple intelligent agents interacting within an environment. These systems can model complex real-world scenarios and are useful for solving distributed problems.

```python
class MultiAgentEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
        self.state = {}
    
    def add_agent(self, agent):
        self.agents.append(agent)
    
    def update(self):
        for agent in self.agents:
            perception = agent.sense(self.state)
            decision = agent.decide(perception)
            agent.act(decision)
            self.state[agent.name] = agent.state

# Create agents and environment
env = MultiAgentEnvironment()
agent1 = AdvancedAgent("Agent1")
agent2 = AdvancedAgent("Agent2")
env.add_agent(agent1)
env.add_agent(agent2)

# Simulate
for _ in range(5):
    env.update()
    print(env.state)
```

Slide 7: Evolutionary Algorithms for Agent Design

Evolutionary algorithms can be used to automatically design and optimize agent behaviors. These algorithms simulate natural selection to evolve increasingly effective agents over multiple generations.

```python
import random

class GeneticAgent:
    def __init__(self, genome):
        self.genome = genome
        self.fitness = 0
    
    def mutate(self, mutation_rate):
        return [g if random.random() > mutation_rate else random.random() for g in self.genome]

def crossover(parent1, parent2):
    split = random.randint(0, len(parent1.genome))
    return GeneticAgent(parent1.genome[:split] + parent2.genome[split:])

def evolve_population(population, generations):
    for _ in range(generations):
        # Evaluate fitness
        for agent in population:
            agent.fitness = sum(agent.genome)  # Simple fitness function
        
        # Select parents and create new population
        new_population = []
        for _ in range(len(population)):
            parent1 = max(random.sample(population, 3), key=lambda x: x.fitness)
            parent2 = max(random.sample(population, 3), key=lambda x: x.fitness)
            child = crossover(parent1, parent2)
            child.genome = child.mutate(mutation_rate=0.1)
            new_population.append(child)
        
        population = new_population
    
    return max(population, key=lambda x: x.fitness)

# Usage
initial_population = [GeneticAgent([random.random() for _ in range(10)]) for _ in range(100)]
best_agent = evolve_population(initial_population, generations=50)
print(f"Best agent genome: {best_agent.genome}")
print(f"Best agent fitness: {best_agent.fitness}")
```

Slide 8: Natural Language Processing for Agentic Systems

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables agents to understand and generate human language, allowing for more intuitive interaction between humans and automated systems.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

class NLPAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
        self.stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    
    def process_text(self, text):
        tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
        tokens = [self.lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token.isalnum()]
        tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in self.stop_words]
        return tokens
    
    def respond(self, user_input):
        processed_input = self.process_text(user_input)
        if "hello" in processed_input:
            return "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
        elif "bye" in processed_input:
            return "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
        else:
            return "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase?"

# Usage
nlp_agent = NLPAgent()
user_input = "Hello, how are you doing today?"
response = nlp_agent.respond(user_input)
print(f"User: {user_input}")
print(f"Agent: {response}")
```

Slide 9: Agent Learning and Adaptation

Adaptive agents can improve their performance over time by learning from experience. This slide demonstrates a simple implementation of an agent that learns to make better decisions based on past outcomes.

```python
import random

class AdaptiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, actions):
        self.actions = actions
        self.q_values = {action: 0 for action in actions}
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
    
    def choose_action(self):
        return max(self.q_values, key=self.q_values.get)
    
    def learn(self, action, reward):
        self.q_values[action] += self.learning_rate * (reward - self.q_values[action])

# Simulation
agent = AdaptiveAgent(['A', 'B', 'C'])
for _ in range(100):
    action = agent.choose_action()
    reward = random.random()  # Simulate environment feedback
    agent.learn(action, reward)
    print(f"Action: {action}, Reward: {reward:.2f}")

print("Final Q-values:", agent.q_values)
```

Slide 10: Agent Communication Protocols

In multi-agent systems, effective communication between agents is crucial. This slide introduces a simple communication protocol for agents to share information and coordinate their actions.

```python
class CommunicatingAgent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.messages = []
    
    def send_message(self, recipient, content):
        message = {"sender": self.name, "recipient": recipient, "content": content}
        recipient.receive_message(message)
    
    def receive_message(self, message):
        self.messages.append(message)
    
    def process_messages(self):
        for message in self.messages:
            print(f"{self.name} received: {message['content']} from {message['sender']}")
        self.messages.clear()

# Usage
agent1 = CommunicatingAgent("Agent1")
agent2 = CommunicatingAgent("Agent2")

agent1.send_message(agent2, "Hello, Agent2!")
agent2.send_message(agent1, "Hi Agent1, how are you?")

agent1.process_messages()
agent2.process_messages()
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Automated Traffic Management

Automated traffic management systems use agentic principles to optimize traffic flow in urban areas. Each traffic light acts as an agent, coordinating with nearby lights and adapting to real-time traffic conditions.

```python
import random

class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.state = "red"
        self.queue_length = 0
    
    def sense(self, environment):
        self.queue_length = environment.get_queue_length(self.id)
    
    def decide(self):
        if self.queue_length > 10 and self.state == "red":
            return "change_to_green"
        elif self.queue_length < 3 and self.state == "green":
            return "change_to_red"
        else:
            return "no_change"
    
    def act(self, decision):
        if decision == "change_to_green":
            self.state = "green"
        elif decision == "change_to_red":
            self.state = "red"

class TrafficEnvironment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lights = [TrafficLight(i) for i in range(4)]
    
    def get_queue_length(self, light_id):
        return random.randint(0, 20)
    
    def update(self):
        for light in self.lights:
            light.sense(self)
            decision = light.decide()
            light.act(decision)
            print(f"Light {light.id}: State = {light.state}, Queue = {light.queue_length}")

# Simulation
env = TrafficEnvironment()
for _ in range(5):
    print("\nTime step:")
    env.update()
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Smart Home Automation

Smart home systems utilize agentic principles to create comfortable and efficient living environments. Various devices act as agents, cooperating to optimize energy usage, security, and user comfort.

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Smart Home Automation

```python
import random

class SmartDevice:
    def __init__(self, name, device_type):
        self.name = name
        self.type = device_type
        self.state = "off"
    
    def sense(self, environment):
        return environment.get_conditions()
    
    def decide(self, conditions):
        if self.type == "thermostat":
            if conditions["temperature"] < 20:
                return "turn_on_heating"
            elif conditions["temperature"] > 25:
                return "turn_on_cooling"
            else:
                return "maintain"
        elif self.type == "light":
            if conditions["luminosity"] < 50 and conditions["time"] > 18:
                return "turn_on"
            else:
                return "turn_off"
    
    def act(self, decision):
        if decision in ["turn_on_heating", "turn_on_cooling", "turn_on"]:
            self.state = "on"
        else:
            self.state = "off"
        print(f"{self.name} is now {self.state}")

class SmartHome:
    def __init__(self):
        self.devices = [
            SmartDevice("Living Room Thermostat", "thermostat"),
            SmartDevice("Bedroom Light", "light"),
            SmartDevice("Kitchen Light", "light")
        ]
    
    def get_conditions(self):
        return {
            "temperature": random.uniform(15, 30),
            "luminosity": random.uniform(0, 100),
            "time": random.randint(0, 23)
        }
    
    def update(self):
        conditions = self.get_conditions()
        print(f"Current conditions: {conditions}")
        for device in self.devices:
            device_conditions = device.sense(self)
            decision = device.decide(device_conditions)
            device.act(decision)

# Simulation
smart_home = SmartHome()
for _ in range(3):
    print("\nTime step:")
    smart_home.update()
```

Slide 14: Challenges in Automated Design of Agentic Systems

Developing automated agentic systems presents several challenges, including scalability, robustness, and ethical considerations. This slide explores these challenges and potential approaches to address them.

```python
class AgentSystem:
    def __init__(self, num_agents):
        self.agents = [Agent(f"Agent_{i}") for i in range(num_agents)]
        self.ethical_constraints = {
            "max_resource_usage": 100,
            "min_fairness_score": 0.7
        }
    
    def run_simulation(self, steps):
        for step in range(steps):
            print(f"Step {step + 1}:")
            total_resource_usage = 0
            fairness_scores = []
            
            for agent in self.agents:
                action = agent.decide()
                resource_usage = self.execute_action(action)
                total_resource_usage += resource_usage
                fairness_scores.append(self.calculate_fairness(agent))
            
            avg_fairness = sum(fairness_scores) / len(fairness_scores)
            
            if total_resource_usage > self.ethical_constraints["max_resource_usage"]:
                print("Warning: Resource usage exceeded ethical constraints")
            
            if avg_fairness < self.ethical_constraints["min_fairness_score"]:
                print("Warning: Fairness score below ethical constraints")
    
    def execute_action(self, action):
        # Simulate action execution and return resource usage
        return random.randint(1, 10)
    
    def calculate_fairness(self, agent):
        # Simulate fairness calculation
        return random.uniform(0.5, 1.0)

# Usage
system = AgentSystem(num_agents=5)
system.run_simulation(steps=3)
```
