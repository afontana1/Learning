## Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought

Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought (SH-CoT) is an advanced prompting technique that enhances language models' reasoning capabilities. It builds upon the Chain of Thought approach by incorporating self-consistency and iterative refinement. This method allows models to generate multiple reasoning paths, evaluate them, and select the most coherent one.

```python
import random

def generate_reasoning_path():
    steps = [
        "Analyze the problem",
        "Break it down into subproblems",
        "Solve each subproblem",
        "Combine solutions",
        "Verify the result"
    ]
    return " -> ".join(random.sample(steps, len(steps)))

print("Example reasoning path:")
print(generate_reasoning_path())
```

Slide 2: Chain of Thought (CoT) Basics

Chain of Thought is a prompting technique that encourages language models to show their reasoning process step-by-step. It improves performance on complex tasks by making the model's thought process explicit and allowing for intermediate computations.

```python
def solve_math_problem(problem):
    print(f"Problem: {problem}")
    print("Step 1: Identify the given information")
    print("Step 2: Determine the appropriate formula")
    print("Step 3: Apply the formula to the given information")
    print("Step 4: Calculate the result")
    print("Step 5: Verify the answer")
    return "Final answer"

solve_math_problem("What is the area of a circle with radius 5?")
```

Slide 3: Self-Consistency in SH-CoT

Self-consistency is a key aspect of SH-CoT. It involves generating multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent one. This approach helps mitigate errors and improves the overall reliability of the model's outputs.

```python
import random

def generate_multiple_paths(n=3):
    paths = []
    for _ in range(n):
        path = generate_reasoning_path()
        paths.append(path)
    return paths

def select_most_consistent(paths):
    # In a real scenario, this would involve more complex logic
    return max(paths, key=len)

paths = generate_multiple_paths()
print("Generated paths:")
for i, path in enumerate(paths, 1):
    print(f"Path {i}: {path}")

consistent_path = select_most_consistent(paths)
print(f"\nMost consistent path: {consistent_path}")
```

Slide 4: Iterative Refinement in SH-CoT

Iterative refinement is another crucial component of SH-CoT. It involves continuously improving the reasoning process by identifying and correcting errors, filling in gaps, and enhancing the overall coherence of the thought chain.

```python
def refine_reasoning(initial_reasoning, iterations=3):
    reasoning = initial_reasoning
    for i in range(iterations):
        print(f"Iteration {i+1}:")
        reasoning = improve_reasoning(reasoning)
        print(reasoning)
        print()
    return reasoning

def improve_reasoning(reasoning):
    # Simulate improvement (in practice, this would involve more complex logic)
    improved = reasoning.replace("unclear", "clear")
    improved += " (Refined)"
    return improved

initial = "The solution is unclear, but we can approach it step by step."
final_reasoning = refine_reasoning(initial)
print("Final refined reasoning:")
print(final_reasoning)
```

Slide 5: Implementing SH-CoT: Step 1 - Generate Multiple Chains

The first step in implementing SH-CoT is to generate multiple chains of thought for a given problem. This diversity allows the model to explore different reasoning paths and increases the chances of finding a correct solution.

```python
import random

def generate_cot(problem):
    steps = [
        f"Understand the problem: {problem}",
        "Identify key information",
        "Formulate a plan",
        "Execute the plan",
        "Check the result"
    ]
    return " -> ".join(steps)

def generate_multiple_cots(problem, n=3):
    return [generate_cot(problem) for _ in range(n)]

problem = "Calculate the volume of a cylinder with radius 3 and height 5"
cots = generate_multiple_cots(problem)

for i, cot in enumerate(cots, 1):
    print(f"Chain of Thought {i}:")
    print(cot)
    print()
```

Slide 6: Implementing SH-CoT: Step 2 - Evaluate Consistency

After generating multiple chains of thought, the next step is to evaluate their consistency. This involves comparing the different reasoning paths and identifying common elements or patterns.

```python
def evaluate_consistency(cots):
    common_elements = set.intersection(*[set(cot.split(" -> ")) for cot in cots])
    consistency_score = len(common_elements) / len(cots[0].split(" -> "))
    return consistency_score, common_elements

cots = generate_multiple_cots("Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 15")
score, common = evaluate_consistency(cots)

print(f"Consistency Score: {score:.2f}")
print("Common Elements:")
for element in common:
    print(f"- {element}")
```

Slide 7: Implementing SH-CoT: Step 3 - Select Best Chain

Based on the consistency evaluation, we select the best chain of thought. This is typically the one that aligns most closely with the common elements identified in the previous step.

```python
def select_best_chain(cots, common_elements):
    scores = []
    for cot in cots:
        score = sum(1 for step in cot.split(" -> ") if step in common_elements)
        scores.append(score)
    best_index = scores.index(max(scores))
    return cots[best_index]

cots = generate_multiple_cots("Find the derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 1")
_, common = evaluate_consistency(cots)
best_cot = select_best_chain(cots, common)

print("Selected Best Chain of Thought:")
print(best_cot)
```

Slide 8: Implementing SH-CoT: Step 4 - Iterative Refinement

The final step in SH-CoT is to iteratively refine the selected chain of thought. This process involves identifying areas for improvement and enhancing the reasoning quality.

```python
def refine_cot(cot, iterations=3):
    refined = cot
    for i in range(iterations):
        print(f"Refinement Iteration {i+1}:")
        refined = improve_cot(refined)
        print(refined)
        print()
    return refined

def improve_cot(cot):
    # Simulate improvement (in practice, this would involve more complex logic)
    improved = cot.replace("Execute", "Carefully execute")
    improved += " -> Verify the solution"
    return improved

initial_cot = "Understand the problem -> Formulate a plan -> Execute the plan"
final_cot = refine_cot(initial_cot)

print("Final Refined Chain of Thought:")
print(final_cot)
```

Slide 9: Advantages of SH-CoT

Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought offers several advantages over traditional prompting techniques. It improves consistency, reduces errors, and enhances the overall quality of reasoning. By generating and refining multiple thought chains, SH-CoT increases the likelihood of arriving at correct solutions for complex problems.

```python
def compare_performance(problem, use_sh_cot=True):
    if use_sh_cot:
        cots = generate_multiple_cots(problem)
        _, common = evaluate_consistency(cots)
        best_cot = select_best_chain(cots, common)
        final_cot = refine_cot(best_cot)
        return len(final_cot.split(" -> "))
    else:
        return len(generate_cot(problem).split(" -> "))

problem = "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement"
sh_cot_steps = compare_performance(problem)
standard_steps = compare_performance(problem, use_sh_cot=False)

print(f"SH-CoT steps: {sh_cot_steps}")
print(f"Standard CoT steps: {standard_steps}")
print(f"Improvement: {(sh_cot_steps - standard_steps) / standard_steps:.2%}")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Debugging Complex Code

SH-CoT can be applied to software debugging, where multiple approaches are considered and refined to identify and fix issues in complex code.

```python
def debug_with_sh_cot(buggy_code):
    print("Buggy Code:")
    print(buggy_code)
    
    approaches = [
        "Print variable values at key points",
        "Use a debugger to step through the code",
        "Check for off-by-one errors",
        "Verify input validation",
        "Review edge cases"
    ]
    
    print("\nGenerated debugging approaches:")
    for i, approach in enumerate(approaches, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {approach}")
    
    print("\nRefined debugging strategy:")
    strategy = " -> ".join(approaches)
    print(strategy)

buggy_code = """
def find_max(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] > max_num:
            max_num = numbers[i-1]
    return max_num
"""

debug_with_sh_cot(buggy_code)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Solving Complex Math Problems

SH-CoT can significantly improve the accuracy of solving complex mathematical problems by exploring multiple solution paths and refining the reasoning process.

```python
import random

def solve_math_problem_with_sh_cot(problem):
    print(f"Problem: {problem}")
    
    approaches = [
        "Break down the problem into smaller steps",
        "Identify relevant formulas and theorems",
        "Draw a diagram or visual representation",
        "Solve a simpler version of the problem first",
        "Work backwards from the desired result"
    ]
    
    selected_approaches = random.sample(approaches, 3)
    print("\nSelected solution approaches:")
    for i, approach in enumerate(selected_approaches, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {approach}")
    
    refined_solution = " -> ".join(selected_approaches)
    refined_solution += " -> Verify the solution"
    
    print("\nRefined solution strategy:")
    print(refined_solution)

problem = "Find the volume of a cone with radius 4 and height 9"
solve_math_problem_with_sh_cot(problem)
```

Slide 12: Challenges and Limitations of SH-CoT

While SH-CoT offers significant improvements, it also faces challenges such as increased computational complexity and the need for careful prompt engineering. Additionally, the effectiveness of SH-CoT can vary depending on the specific task and model being used.

```python
import time

def measure_complexity(func, *args):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = func(*args)
    end_time = time.time()
    return result, end_time - start_time

def standard_cot(problem):
    return generate_cot(problem)

def sh_cot(problem):
    cots = generate_multiple_cots(problem)
    _, common = evaluate_consistency(cots)
    best_cot = select_best_chain(cots, common)
    return refine_cot(best_cot)

problem = "Explain the process of photosynthesis"

_, standard_time = measure_complexity(standard_cot, problem)
_, sh_cot_time = measure_complexity(sh_cot, problem)

print(f"Standard CoT time: {standard_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"SH-CoT time: {sh_cot_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Time increase: {(sh_cot_time - standard_time) / standard_time:.2%}")
```

Slide 13: Future Directions and Potential Improvements

The field of Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought is still evolving. Future research may focus on optimizing the generation and selection of thought chains, incorporating domain-specific knowledge, and developing more efficient implementations to reduce computational overhead.

```python
import random

def simulate_future_sh_cot(problem, num_chains=5, refinement_steps=3):
    print(f"Problem: {problem}")
    
    # Generate multiple chains with domain-specific knowledge
    chains = [generate_domain_specific_cot(problem) for _ in range(num_chains)]
    
    # Optimize chain selection
    best_chain = optimize_chain_selection(chains)
    
    # Efficient refinement
    refined_chain = efficient_refinement(best_chain, refinement_steps)
    
    print("\nFinal optimized and refined chain:")
    print(refined_chain)

def generate_domain_specific_cot(problem):
    # Simulate domain-specific chain generation
    return f"Domain-specific approach to: {problem}"

def optimize_chain_selection(chains):
    # Simulate optimized chain selection
    return random.choice(chains)

def efficient_refinement(chain, steps):
    # Simulate efficient refinement process
    for i in range(steps):
        chain += f" -> Refinement step {i+1}"
    return chain

simulate_future_sh_cot("Develop a sustainable energy plan for a small city")
```
