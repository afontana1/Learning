## Accelerated Generation Techniques in Large Language Models

Slide 1: Introduction to Accelerated Generation Techniques in LLMs

Accelerated generation techniques refer to methods that enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text more efficiently and with improved performance. These techniques are crucial for applications that demand real-time or near-real-time responses, such as conversational AI assistants, machine translation, and text summarization.

```python
import transformers

# Load a pre-trained LLM
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```

Slide 2: Beam Search

Beam search is a commonly used accelerated generation technique that explores the most promising text candidates at each step. Instead of considering all possible extensions, it keeps only the top-k most likely candidates based on their log probabilities.

```python
from transformers import top_k_top_p_filtering

input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    num_beams=5,  # Number of beams for beam search
    early_stopping=True,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 3: Top-k Sampling

Top-k sampling is a technique that restricts the next token selection to the k most likely tokens based on their probabilities. This helps to avoid unlikely or nonsensical token choices and can improve the coherence and relevance of the generated text.

```python
from transformers import top_k_top_p_filtering

input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,  # Number of highest probability tokens to consider
    top_p=1.0,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 4: Top-p Sampling (Nucleus Sampling)

Top-p sampling, also known as nucleus sampling, is a technique that restricts the next token selection to the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a specified threshold (p). This allows for more diverse and creative generations while still maintaining coherence.

```python
from transformers import top_k_top_p_filtering

input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=0,  # Disable top-k filtering
    top_p=0.92,  # Cumulative probability threshold
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 5: Temperature Sampling

Temperature sampling is a technique that adjusts the randomness of the generated text. Higher temperature values (> 1.0) increase the diversity of the generated text, while lower temperature values (< 1.0) make the generations more focused and predictable.

```python
import torch

input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    temperature=0.7,  # Temperature value
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 6: Greedy Search

Greedy search is a simple accelerated generation technique that selects the token with the highest probability at each step. While fast, it can lead to less diverse and potentially repetitive generations.

```python
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=False,  # Disable sampling (use greedy search)
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 7: Early Stopping

Early stopping is a technique that stops the generation process when a certain condition is met, such as reaching a specified maximum length or encountering a stop token. This can help to prevent the generation from becoming too long or diverging from the intended topic.

```python
stop_token = "<|endoftext|>"

input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    early_stopping=True,  # Enable early stopping
    eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,  # Stop token ID
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 8: Sequence Repetition Penalty

Sequence repetition penalty is a technique that discourages the model from repeating the same sequences of tokens. This can help to increase the diversity and coherence of the generated text by avoiding repetitive patterns.

```python
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("The quick brown fox", return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=50,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=2.0,  # Repetition penalty value
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(text)
```

Slide 9: Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting the input prompt to guide the LLM towards generating the desired output. This can involve techniques such as providing context, examples, or instructions to the model.

```python
prompt = "Write a short story about a brave explorer who discovers a hidden treasure:\n\n"

input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
output_ids = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    max_length=200,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.95,
    num_return_sequences=1,
)
story = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(story)
```

Slide 10: Finetuning for Specific Tasks

Finetuning is the process of further training a pre-trained LLM on a specific task or domain-specific dataset. This can improve the model's performance and generation quality for the target task.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load data and prepare for finetuning
train_dataset = ...
eval_dataset = ...

training_args = TrainingArguments(...)
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

# Finetune the model
trainer.train()
```

SSlide 11: Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods combine the outputs of multiple LLMs to generate more robust and diverse text. This can involve techniques such as voting, averaging, or re-ranking the generated sequences. Ensemble methods can help mitigate individual model biases and weaknesses, potentially improving the overall quality and reliability of the generated text.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load multiple LLMs
models = [
    pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2"),
    pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-neo"),
    pipeline("text-generation", model="opt"),
]

# Generate text from each model
generated_texts = [model("The quick brown fox")[0]["generated_text"] for model in models]

# Combine the generated texts using an ensemble method
# (e.g., voting, averaging, re-ranking)
ensemble_text = combine_ensemble_outputs(generated_texts)

print(ensemble_text)

# Example combine_ensemble_outputs function (voting)
def combine_ensemble_outputs(texts):
    # Count the occurrences of each token across the generated texts
    token_counts = {}
    for text in texts:
        for token in text.split():
            token_counts[token] = token_counts.get(token, 0) + 1

    # Construct the ensemble text by selecting the most commonly occurring tokens
    ensemble_text = []
    for token in max_sorted_tokens(token_counts):
        ensemble_text.append(token)
        if token in [".", "?", "!"]:
            break

    return " ".join(ensemble_text)
```

Slide 12: Caching and Parallelization

Caching and parallelization techniques can be employed to improve the computational efficiency of LLM generation. Caching involves storing and reusing previously computed results, while parallelization leverages multiple processors or GPUs to accelerate computations.

```python
from transformers import CachedAutoCrossAttentionModel

# Load a cached LLM for faster generation
model = CachedAutoCrossAttentionModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Parallelize the generation process across multiple GPUs
model.parallelize()
```

Slide 13: Inference Optimization

Inference optimization techniques aim to reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of LLM generation during inference (evaluation or deployment). This can involve techniques such as quantization, pruning, and efficient model architectures.

```python
from transformers import LLMOptimizer

# Load an optimized LLM for efficient inference
optimized_model = LLMOptimizer.from_pretrained(
    "gpt2",
    optimization_level="l2",  # Level of optimization
    use_cpu=False,  # Use GPU for inference
)
```
