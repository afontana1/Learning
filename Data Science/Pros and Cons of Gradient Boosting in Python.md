## Pros and Cons of Gradient Boosting in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines weak learners to create a strong predictive model. It builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=5, noise=0.1)
gb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model.fit(X, y)
```

Slide 2: Advantages of Gradient Boosting: High Performance

Gradient Boosting often outperforms other machine learning algorithms, especially for structured data problems. It can capture complex non-linear relationships and handle various data types.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

gb_scores = cross_val_score(GradientBoostingRegressor(), X, y, cv=5)
rf_scores = cross_val_score(RandomForestRegressor(), X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Gradient Boosting mean score: {gb_scores.mean():.4f}")
print(f"Random Forest mean score: {rf_scores.mean():.4f}")
```

Slide 3: Advantages of Gradient Boosting: Feature Importance

Gradient Boosting provides built-in feature importance, helping identify which variables are most influential in making predictions. This aids in feature selection and model interpretation.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

feature_importance = gb_model.feature_importances_
sorted_idx = np.argsort(feature_importance)
pos = np.arange(sorted_idx.shape[0])

plt.barh(pos, feature_importance[sorted_idx])
plt.yticks(pos, [f"Feature {i}" for i in sorted_idx])
plt.title("Feature Importance")
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Advantages of Gradient Boosting: Handling Missing Data

Gradient Boosting algorithms can handle missing data effectively by treating it as a separate category or using surrogate splits.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

X_with_missing = pd.DataFrame(X).()
X_with_missing.iloc[0:10, 0] = np.nan

imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_with_missing)

gb_model_missing = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model_missing.fit(X_imputed, y)
```

Slide 5: Advantages of Gradient Boosting: Robustness to Outliers

Gradient Boosting is relatively robust to outliers due to its iterative nature and the use of different loss functions.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

X_with_outliers = X.()
X_with_outliers[0, 0] = 1000  # Add an outlier

scaler = RobustScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_with_outliers)

gb_model_robust = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model_robust.fit(X_scaled, y)
```

Slide 6: Disadvantages of Gradient Boosting: Computational Complexity

Gradient Boosting can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets or when using a high number of estimators.

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()
gb_model_complex = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=1000)
gb_model_complex.fit(X, y)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Training time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 7: Disadvantages of Gradient Boosting: Risk of Overfitting

Gradient Boosting can overfit if not properly tuned, especially with noisy data or when using too many estimators.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

gb_overfit = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=10)
gb_overfit.fit(X_train, y_train)

train_score = gb_overfit.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = gb_overfit.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Training R² score: {train_score:.4f}")
print(f"Testing R² score: {test_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 8: Mitigating Overfitting: Early Stopping

Early stopping can help prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping training when it starts to degrade.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

gb_early_stop = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=1000, validation_fraction=0.2, n_iter_no_change=5, tol=1e-4)
gb_early_stop.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Number of estimators used: {gb_early_stop.n_estimators_}")
```

Slide 9: Disadvantages of Gradient Boosting: Limited Interpretability

While Gradient Boosting provides feature importance, the overall model can be difficult to interpret due to its complex structure of multiple decision trees.

```python
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(gb_model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, plot_type="bar")
```

Slide 10: Gradient Boosting Hyperparameters: Learning Rate

The learning rate controls the contribution of each tree to the final prediction. A lower learning rate often leads to better generalization but requires more trees.

```python
gb_low_lr = GradientBoostingRegressor(learning_rate=0.01, n_estimators=1000)
gb_high_lr = GradientBoostingRegressor(learning_rate=0.5, n_estimators=100)

gb_low_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
gb_high_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Low LR score: {gb_low_lr.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
print(f"High LR score: {gb_high_lr.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Gradient Boosting Hyperparameters: Tree Depth

The maximum depth of individual trees affects the model's ability to capture complex relationships. Deeper trees can lead to overfitting.

```python
gb_shallow = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=3)
gb_deep = GradientBoostingRegressor(max_depth=10)

gb_shallow.fit(X_train, y_train)
gb_deep.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Shallow trees score: {gb_shallow.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
print(f"Deep trees score: {gb_deep.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Gradient Boosting Hyperparameters: Subsample

Subsampling can help reduce overfitting by using only a fraction of the training data for each tree, introducing randomness.

```python
gb_subsample = GradientBoostingRegressor(subsample=0.5)
gb_subsample.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Subsampling score: {gb_subsample.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
```

Slide 13: Gradient Boosting vs Other Ensemble Methods

Gradient Boosting often performs well compared to other ensemble methods like Random Forests or AdaBoost, especially when properly tuned.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor

gb = GradientBoostingRegressor()
rf = RandomForestRegressor()
ada = AdaBoostRegressor()

models = [gb, rf, ada]
names = ['Gradient Boosting', 'Random Forest', 'AdaBoost']

for name, model in zip(names, models):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"{name} R² score: {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 14: Gradient Boosting for Classification

Gradient Boosting can also be used for classification tasks, adjusting the loss function accordingly.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier()
gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = gb_clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Classification accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```
