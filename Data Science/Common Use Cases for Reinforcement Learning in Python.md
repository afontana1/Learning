## Common Use Cases for Reinforcement Learning in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. RL is inspired by behavioral psychology and has applications in various fields, from robotics to game playing.

```python
import gym
import numpy as np

# Create a simple environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Define a basic agent
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, action_space):
        self.action_space = action_space

    def choose_action(self, observation):
        return self.action_space.sample()  # Random action

# Run a single episode
agent = SimpleAgent(env.action_space)
observation = env.reset()
done = False
total_reward = 0

while not done:
    action = agent.choose_action(observation)
    observation, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
    total_reward += reward

print(f"Total reward: {total_reward}")
```

Slide 2: Q-Learning: A Fundamental RL Algorithm

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state. It creates a Q-table that stores the expected rewards for each action in each state. The agent uses this table to make decisions, updating it based on the rewards received.

```python
import numpy as np

# Initialize Q-table
n_states = 10
n_actions = 4
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

# Q-Learning parameters
alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration rate

def choose_action(state):
    if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
        return np.random.choice(n_actions)  # Explore
    else:
        return np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # Exploit

# Q-Learning update rule
def update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state):
    Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])

# Example update
current_state = 0
action = choose_action(current_state)
reward = 1
next_state = 1

update_q_table(current_state, action, reward, next_state)
print("Updated Q-table:")
print(Q)
```

Slide 3: Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

Deep Q-Networks combine Q-Learning with deep neural networks to handle high-dimensional state spaces. Instead of a Q-table, DQN uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function. This allows it to work with complex environments like video games or robotics.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Initialize DQN
input_size = 4  # State size
output_size = 2  # Action size
dqn = DQN(input_size, output_size)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(dqn.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example forward pass and backpropagation
state = torch.randn(1, input_size)
target = torch.randn(1, output_size)

# Forward pass
output = dqn(state)

# Compute loss
loss = criterion(output, target)

# Backpropagation
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

Slide 4: Policy Gradient Methods

Policy Gradient methods directly learn the policy without using a value function. They optimize the policy to maximize expected rewards by adjusting the probability of taking actions in given states. REINFORCE is a classic policy gradient algorithm.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.distributions import Categorical

class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return F.softmax(self.fc(x), dim=1)

# Initialize policy network
input_size = 4  # State size
output_size = 2  # Action size
policy_net = PolicyNetwork(input_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy_net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

def select_action(state):
    state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
    probs = policy_net(state)
    m = Categorical(probs)
    action = m.sample()
    return action.item(), m.log_prob(action)

def update_policy(rewards, log_probs):
    R = 0
    policy_loss = []
    returns = []
    for r in rewards[::-1]:
        R = r + 0.99 * R
        returns.insert(0, R)
    returns = torch.tensor(returns)
    returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-9)
    for log_prob, R in zip(log_probs, returns):
        policy_loss.append(-log_prob * R)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    policy_loss = torch.cat(policy_loss).sum()
    policy_loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Example usage
state = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
action, log_prob = select_action(state)
print(f"Selected action: {action}")
```

Slide 5: Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic methods combine the strengths of value-based and policy-based methods. They use two networks: an actor that decides which action to take, and a critic that evaluates the action. This approach often leads to more stable and efficient learning.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.distributions import Categorical

class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, n_actions):
        super(ActorCritic, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.actor = nn.Linear(128, n_actions)
        self.critic = nn.Linear(128, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        action_probs = F.softmax(self.actor(x), dim=-1)
        state_values = self.critic(x)
        return action_probs, state_values

# Initialize ActorCritic network
input_size = 4  # State size
n_actions = 2   # Action size
ac_net = ActorCritic(input_size, n_actions)
optimizer = optim.Adam(ac_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

def select_action(state):
    state = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
    action_probs, _ = ac_net(state)
    m = Categorical(action_probs)
    action = m.sample()
    return action.item(), m.log_prob(action)

def update_ac(state, action, reward, next_state, done):
    state = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
    next_state = torch.FloatTensor(next_state).unsqueeze(0)
    
    _, critic_value = ac_net(state)
    _, next_critic_value = ac_net(next_state)
    
    target = reward + (0.99 * next_critic_value * (1 - int(done)))
    critic_loss = F.mse_loss(critic_value, target.detach())
    
    action_probs, _ = ac_net(state)
    m = Categorical(action_probs)
    log_prob = m.log_prob(torch.tensor([action]))
    actor_loss = -log_prob * (target - critic_value).detach()
    
    loss = actor_loss + critic_loss
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Example usage
state = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
action, _ = select_action(state)
next_state = [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
reward = 1
done = False

update_ac(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
print(f"Updated ActorCritic network")
```

Slide 6: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

PPO is a policy gradient method that aims to improve training stability by limiting the size of policy updates. It uses a clipped surrogate objective to prevent excessively large policy changes, making it easier to tune and more robust across a variety of tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

class PPONet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(PPONet, self).__init__()
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 64),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(64, output_size),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 64),
            nn.Tanh(),
            nn.Linear(64, 1)
        )

    def forward(self, state):
        return self.actor(state), self.critic(state)

def ppo_update(ppo_net, optimizer, states, actions, old_log_probs, rewards, dones, epsilon=0.2):
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    states = torch.FloatTensor(states).to(device)
    actions = torch.LongTensor(actions).to(device)
    old_log_probs = torch.FloatTensor(old_log_probs).to(device)
    rewards = torch.FloatTensor(rewards).to(device)
    dones = torch.FloatTensor(dones).to(device)

    for _ in range(10):  # PPO update iterations
        action_probs, state_values = ppo_net(states)
        dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(action_probs)
        new_log_probs = dist.log_prob(actions)

        ratio = torch.exp(new_log_probs - old_log_probs)
        surr1 = ratio * rewards
        surr2 = torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - epsilon, 1 + epsilon) * rewards
        actor_loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2).mean()

        critic_loss = nn.MSELoss()(state_values, rewards)
        loss = actor_loss + 0.5 * critic_loss

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Example usage
input_size = 4
output_size = 2
ppo_net = PPONet(input_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(ppo_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulate collected data
states = np.random.rand(100, input_size)
actions = np.random.randint(0, output_size, 100)
old_log_probs = np.random.rand(100)
rewards = np.random.rand(100)
dones = np.random.choice([0, 1], 100)

ppo_update(ppo_net, optimizer, states, actions, old_log_probs, rewards, dones)
print("PPO update completed")
```

Slide 7: Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

Soft Actor-Critic is an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. SAC aims to maximize both the expected return and the entropy of the policy, which encourages exploration and leads to more robust policies.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np

class SACNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super(SACNet, self).__init__()
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, action_dim * 2)
        )
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim + action_dim, 256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(256, 1)
        )

    def forward(self, state):
        mean, log_std = self.actor(state).chunk(2, dim=-1)
        return mean, log_std.clamp(-20, 2)

    def evaluate(self, state, action):
        return self.critic(torch.cat([state, action], dim=1))

# Example usage
state_dim, action_dim = 4, 2
sac_net = SACNet(state_dim, action_dim)
optimizer = optim.Adam(sac_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulated data
state = torch.randn(1, state_dim)
action = torch.randn(1, action_dim)

# Forward pass
mean, log_std = sac_net(state)
q_value = sac_net.evaluate(state, action)

print(f"Action mean: {mean.detach().numpy()}")
print(f"Q-value: {q_value.item()}")
```

Slide 8: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning extends RL to environments with multiple agents. In MARL, agents must learn to cooperate or compete with each other, leading to complex dynamics and emergent behaviors. MARL has applications in robotics, game theory, and distributed control systems.

```python
import numpy as np

class SimpleMARL:
    def __init__(self, n_agents, n_actions):
        self.n_agents = n_agents
        self.n_actions = n_actions
        self.q_tables = [np.zeros((n_agents, n_actions)) for _ in range(n_agents)]

    def choose_actions(self, epsilon=0.1):
        actions = []
        for i in range(self.n_agents):
            if np.random.random() < epsilon:
                actions.append(np.random.randint(self.n_actions))
            else:
                actions.append(np.argmax(self.q_tables[i][i]))
        return actions

    def update(self, actions, rewards, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.95):
        for i in range(self.n_agents):
            for j in range(self.n_agents):
                self.q_tables[i][j][actions[j]] += learning_rate * (
                    rewards[i] + discount_factor * np.max(self.q_tables[i][j]) - 
                    self.q_tables[i][j][actions[j]]
                )

# Example usage
n_agents, n_actions = 3, 4
marl = SimpleMARL(n_agents, n_actions)

# Simulate one step
actions = marl.choose_actions()
rewards = np.random.random(n_agents)  # Simulated rewards
marl.update(actions, rewards)

print(f"Chosen actions: {actions}")
print(f"Q-table for agent 0:\n{marl.q_tables[0]}")
```

Slide 9: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)

Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover the reward function of an agent given its observed behavior. IRL is useful when the reward function is unknown or difficult to specify, such as in robotic imitation learning or analyzing animal behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def feature_expectations(trajectories, feature_func, gamma=0.99):
    fe = np.zeros(feature_func(trajectories[0][0]).shape)
    for trajectory in trajectories:
        for t, state in enumerate(trajectory):
            fe += (gamma ** t) * feature_func(state)
    return fe / len(trajectories)

def irl(expert_fe, initial_omega, mdp, feature_func, learning_rate=0.1, max_iter=100):
    omega = initial_omega
    
    def obj_func(omega):
        policy = solve_mdp(mdp, omega)  # Assume we have this function
        learner_fe = feature_expectations(generate_trajectories(policy), feature_func)
        return -np.dot(omega, expert_fe - learner_fe)
    
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        result = minimize(obj_func, omega, method='L-BFGS-B')
        omega = result.x
    
    return omega

# Example usage (simplified)
def simple_feature_func(state):
    return np.array(state)

expert_trajectories = [
    [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)],
    [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
]

expert_fe = feature_expectations(expert_trajectories, simple_feature_func)
initial_omega = np.random.rand(2)
mdp = None  # Simplified example, assume we have an MDP

recovered_reward = irl(expert_fe, initial_omega, mdp, simple_feature_func)
print(f"Recovered reward weights: {recovered_reward}")
```

Slide 10: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning decomposes complex tasks into simpler subtasks, allowing agents to learn and operate at multiple levels of abstraction. HRL can improve learning efficiency and transfer learning in complex environments.

```python
import numpy as np

class HierarchicalAgent:
    def __init__(self, n_high_level_actions, n_low_level_actions):
        self.high_level_policy = np.ones(n_high_level_actions) / n_high_level_actions
        self.low_level_policies = [np.ones(n_low_level_actions) / n_low_level_actions 
                                   for _ in range(n_high_level_actions)]

    def choose_high_level_action(self):
        return np.random.choice(len(self.high_level_policy), p=self.high_level_policy)

    def choose_low_level_action(self, high_level_action):
        return np.random.choice(len(self.low_level_policies[high_level_action]), 
                                p=self.low_level_policies[high_level_action])

    def update(self, high_level_action, low_level_action, reward, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.high_level_policy[high_level_action] += learning_rate * reward
        self.high_level_policy /= np.sum(self.high_level_policy)
        
        self.low_level_policies[high_level_action][low_level_action] += learning_rate * reward
        self.low_level_policies[high_level_action] /= np.sum(self.low_level_policies[high_level_action])

# Example usage
n_high_level_actions, n_low_level_actions = 3, 4
agent = HierarchicalAgent(n_high_level_actions, n_low_level_actions)

# Simulate one step
high_action = agent.choose_high_level_action()
low_action = agent.choose_low_level_action(high_action)
reward = np.random.random()  # Simulated reward
agent.update(high_action, low_action, reward)

print(f"High-level policy: {agent.high_level_policy}")
print(f"Low-level policy for action {high_action}: {agent.low_level_policies[high_action]}")
```

Slide 11: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

Model-Based RL algorithms learn a model of the environment's dynamics and use it for planning and decision-making. This approach can be more sample-efficient than model-free methods, especially in environments with complex dynamics.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

class ModelBasedRL:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        self.state_dim = state_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim
        self.model = LinearRegression()
        self.buffer = []

    def add_experience(self, state, action, next_state):
        self.buffer.append((state, action, next_state))

    def train_model(self):
        if len(self.buffer) < 100:  # Wait for enough data
            return
        
        X = np.array([np.concatenate([s, a]) for s, a, _ in self.buffer])
        y = np.array([ns for _, _, ns in self.buffer])
        self.model.fit(X, y)

    def predict_next_state(self, state, action):
        X = np.concatenate([state, action]).reshape(1, -1)
        return self.model.predict(X)[0]

    def plan(self, initial_state, horizon=5):
        best_actions = []
        best_reward = float('-inf')

        for _ in range(100):  # Simple random shooting
            state = initial_state
            actions = np.random.rand(horizon, self.action_dim)
            total_reward = 0

            for action in actions:
                next_state = self.predict_next_state(state, action)
                reward = self.compute_reward(state, action, next_state)  # Assume we have this
                total_reward += reward
                state = next_state

            if total_reward > best_reward:
                best_reward = total_reward
                best_actions = actions

        return best_actions[0]  # Return the first action of the best sequence

# Example usage
state_dim, action_dim = 4, 2
agent = ModelBasedRL(state_dim, action_dim)

# Simulate experience
for _ in range(1000):
    state = np.random.rand(state_dim)
    action = np.random.rand(action_dim)
    next_state = np.random.rand(state_dim)  # Simplified transition
    agent.add_experience(state, action, next_state)

agent.train_model()

initial_state = np.random.rand(state_dim)
best_action = agent.plan(initial_state)
print(f"Best action for initial state: {best_action}")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Robotic Manipulation

Reinforcement Learning has been successfully applied to robotic manipulation tasks, such as grasping and object manipulation. In this example, we'll simulate a simple 2D robotic arm learning to reach a target position.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class RoboticArm:
    def __init__(self, link_lengths):
        self.link_lengths = np.array(link_lengths)
        self.n_joints = len(link_lengths)
        self.joint_angles = np.zeros(self.n_joints)

    def forward_kinematics(self):
        x, y = 0, 0
        for i in range(self.n_joints):
            angle = np.sum(self.joint_angles[:i+1])
            x += self.link_lengths[i] * np.cos(angle)
            y += self.link_lengths[i] * np.sin(angle)
        return x, y

    def step(self, action):
        self.joint_angles += action
        self.joint_angles = np.clip(self.joint_angles, -np.pi, np.pi)
        end_effector = self.forward_kinematics()
        return np.array(end_effector)

class RLAgent:
    def __init__(self, n_joints):
        self.n_joints = n_joints
        self.q_table = {}

    def get_action(self, state, epsilon=0.1):
        state = tuple(np.round(state, 2))
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = np.zeros((self.n_joints, 3))  # 3 actions: -0.1, 0, 0.1
        
        if np.random.random() < epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(3, self.n_joints) - 1
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state], axis=1) - 1

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.95):
        state = tuple(np.round(state, 2))
        next_state = tuple(np.round(next_state, 2))
        
        if next_state not in self.q_table:

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Traffic Light Control

Reinforcement Learning can be applied to optimize traffic light control systems, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow. In this example, we'll simulate a simple intersection controlled by an RL agent.

```python
import numpy as np

class Intersection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue_ns = 0  # North-South queue
        self.queue_ew = 0  # East-West queue
        self.green_ns = True  # True if North-South has green light

    def step(self, action):
        # action: 0 = no change, 1 = change light
        if action == 1:
            self.green_ns = not self.green_ns

        # Simulate traffic flow
        if self.green_ns:
            self.queue_ns = max(0, self.queue_ns - 3)
            self.queue_ew += np.random.randint(0, 4)
        else:
            self.queue_ew = max(0, self.queue_ew - 3)
            self.queue_ns += np.random.randint(0, 4)

        return self.get_state(), self.get_reward()

    def get_state(self):
        return (self.queue_ns, self.queue_ew, int(self.green_ns))

    def get_reward(self):
        return -(self.queue_ns + self.queue_ew)

class TrafficAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q_table = {}

    def get_action(self, state, epsilon=0.1):
        if state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[state] = [0, 0]
        
        if np.random.random() < epsilon:
            return np.random.randint(2)
        else:
            return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.95):
        if next_state not in self.q_table:
            self.q_table[next_state] = [0, 0]
        
        self.q_table[state][action] += learning_rate * (
            reward + discount_factor * max(self.q_table[next_state]) - 
            self.q_table[state][action]
        )

# Training loop
intersection = Intersection()
agent = TrafficAgent()

for episode in range(1000):
    state = intersection.get_state()
    
    for _ in range(100):
        action = agent.get_action(state)
        next_state, reward = intersection.step(action)
        
        agent.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state

# Test the trained agent
total_reward = 0
for _ in range(100):
    state = intersection.get_state()
    action = agent.get_action(state, epsilon=0)
    _, reward = intersection.step(action)
    total_reward += reward

print(f"Average reward over 100 steps: {total_reward / 100}")
```

Slide 14: Challenges and Future Directions in Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning has made significant progress, but several challenges remain:

1. Sample Efficiency: Many RL algorithms require a large number of interactions with the environment to learn effective policies. Improving sample efficiency is crucial for real-world applications.
2. Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off: Balancing the need to explore new actions with exploiting known good actions remains a fundamental challenge in RL.
3. Transfer Learning: Developing methods to transfer knowledge between tasks and environments can greatly improve the applicability of RL.
4. Safe Exploration: In critical applications, ensuring that the agent's exploration doesn't lead to catastrophic failures is essential.
5. Scalability: As problems become more complex, scaling RL algorithms to high-dimensional state and action spaces becomes challenging.
6. Interpretability: Making RL decisions more interpretable and explainable is crucial for building trust in RL systems.
7. Multi-agent RL: Developing efficient algorithms for multiple agents learning simultaneously in shared environments is an active area of research.
8. Combining RL with other AI techniques: Integrating RL with areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and causal inference can lead to more powerful and versatile AI systems.

Future directions in RL research include:

1. Meta-learning: Developing algorithms that can quickly adapt to new tasks.
2. Hierarchical RL: Improving methods for learning at multiple levels of abstraction.
3. Model-based RL: Enhancing sample efficiency by learning and using environment models.
4. Offline RL: Learning from fixed datasets without direct environment interaction.
5. Causal RL: Incorporating causal reasoning to improve generalization and robustness.

As these challenges are addressed, RL is poised to play an increasingly important role in developing intelligent systems capable of solving complex real-world problems.
