## Top 10 Ensemble Methods in Data Science

Slide 1: Ensemble Methods in Data Science

Ensemble methods in data science combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce errors. These techniques leverage the strengths of various algorithms to create a more robust and reliable model. By aggregating the predictions of multiple models, ensemble methods can often outperform individual models, making them a powerful tool in a data scientist's arsenal.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Create base models
log_clf = LogisticRegression()
tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
svm_clf = SVC(probability=True)

# Create voting classifier
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('lr', log_clf), ('dt', tree_clf), ('svc', svm_clf)],
    voting='soft'
)

# Fit the ensemble model
voting_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = voting_clf.predict(X_test)
```

Slide 2: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

Bagging is an ensemble technique that combines multiple models to reduce variance. It creates subsets of the original dataset through random sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling). Each subset is used to train a separate model, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all models for regression tasks or by majority voting for classification tasks.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
import numpy as np

# Create a bagging classifier with decision trees as base estimators
bagging_clf = BaggingClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    n_estimators=10,
    random_state=42
)

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 1).astype(int)

# Fit the bagging classifier
bagging_clf.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = bagging_clf.predict([[0.5, 0.5], [1.5, 1.5]])
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

Slide 3: Boosting

Boosting is an ensemble method that sequentially builds models to reduce bias. It focuses on difficult-to-classify instances by giving them more weight in subsequent iterations. Each new model tries to correct the errors made by the previous models. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Gradient Boosting Classifier
gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = gb_clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 4: Stacking

Stacking is an ensemble method that uses a meta-learner to combine the predictions of multiple base models. It trains several first-level models on the original dataset and then uses their predictions as features to train a second-level meta-model. This approach allows the meta-model to learn how to best combine the predictions of the base models.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Assume X and y are your features and target variables

# First-level models
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
svm_model = SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)
lr_model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)

# Generate cross-validation predictions for each first-level model
rf_preds = cross_val_predict(rf_model, X, y, cv=5, method='predict_proba')
svm_preds = cross_val_predict(svm_model, X, y, cv=5, method='predict_proba')
lr_preds = cross_val_predict(lr_model, X, y, cv=5, method='predict_proba')

# Combine predictions as new features
stacked_features = np.column_stack((rf_preds, svm_preds, lr_preds))

# Train a meta-model
meta_model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
meta_model.fit(stacked_features, y)

# Make final predictions
final_preds = meta_model.predict(stacked_features)

# Evaluate the stacked model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y, final_preds)
print(f"Stacked Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the original dataset. It introduces additional randomness when growing trees by selecting a random subset of features at each split. This approach reduces overfitting and improves generalization. Random Forest is known for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Random Forest Classifier
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42)
rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Feature importance
feature_importance = rf_clf.feature_importances_
for i, importance in enumerate(feature_importance):
    print(f"Feature {i+1} importance: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 6: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)

AdaBoost is a boosting algorithm that focuses on misclassified instances by adjusting their weights. It sequentially trains weak learners, typically decision trees with a single level (decision stumps). After each iteration, the algorithm increases the weights of misclassified samples, forcing subsequent models to focus on these difficult cases. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all weak learners.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train an AdaBoost Classifier
ada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1),
    n_estimators=50,
    learning_rate=1.0,
    random_state=42
)
ada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = ada_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"AdaBoost Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

feature_importance = ada_clf.feature_importances_
plt.bar(range(len(feature_importance)), feature_importance)
plt.xlabel("Feature Index")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("AdaBoost Feature Importance")
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble method that builds models sequentially, with each new model trying to correct the errors of the previous ones. It uses gradient descent to minimize a loss function. At each iteration, it fits a new model to the residuals of the previous model, gradually improving the overall prediction. Gradient Boosting is known for its high accuracy and flexibility in handling different types of problems.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Generate sample regression data
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, noise=0.1, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a Gradient Boosting Regressor
gb_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)
gb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = gb_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
print(f"Gradient Boosting RMSE: {rmse:.2f}")

# Plot training deviance
test_score = np.zeros((100,), dtype=np.float64)
for i, y_pred in enumerate(gb_reg.staged_predict(X_test)):
    test_score[i] = gb_reg.loss_(y_test, y_pred)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(np.arange(100) + 1, gb_reg.train_score_, 'b-', label='Training Set Deviance')
plt.plot(np.arange(100) + 1, test_score, 'r-', label='Test Set Deviance')
plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.xlabel('Boosting Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Deviance')
plt.title('Gradient Boosting Learning Curve')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

XGBoost is an optimized and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It introduces regularization terms to prevent overfitting and uses a more sophisticated way to find the best split points in trees. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance, often winning machine learning competitions. It can handle large datasets efficiently and provides various hyperparameters for fine-tuning.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train an XGBoost Classifier
xgb_clf = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)
xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose=False)

# Make predictions
y_pred = xgb_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"XGBoost Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(range(len(xgb_clf.feature_importances_)), xgb_clf.feature_importances_)
plt.xlabel("Feature Index")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("XGBoost Feature Importance")
plt.show()

# Plot learning curve
results = xgb_clf.evals_result()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(results['validation_0']['logloss'])), results['validation_0']['logloss'], label='Test')
plt.xlabel('Number of Boosting Rounds')
plt.ylabel('Log Loss')
plt.title('XGBoost Learning Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)

LightGBM is a fast, distributed, and high-performance gradient boosting framework. It uses histogram-based algorithms to speed up training and reduce memory usage. LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise rather than level-wise, which can lead to better accuracy with fewer splits. It's particularly efficient for large datasets and high-dimensional problems.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a LightGBM Classifier
lgbm_clf = LGBMClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=3,
    random_state=42
)
lgbm_clf.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose=False)

# Make predictions
y_pred = lgbm_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"LightGBM Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Plot feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(range(len(lgbm_clf.feature_importances_)), lgbm_clf.feature_importances_)
plt.xlabel("Feature Index")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.title("LightGBM Feature Importance")
plt.show()

# Plot learning curve
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(lgbm_clf.evals_result_['valid_0']['binary_logloss'])), 
         lgbm_clf.evals_result_['valid_0']['binary_logloss'], label='Test')
plt.xlabel('Number of Boosting Rounds')
plt.ylabel('Binary Log Loss')
plt.title('LightGBM Learning Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: CatBoost (Categorical Boosting)

CatBoost is a gradient boosting library that excels at handling categorical features. It uses a novel technique called Ordered Boosting to reduce prediction shift caused by target leakage. CatBoost also implements symmetric trees, which can improve generalization. It's known for its high performance and ability to handle categorical variables without extensive preprocessing.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data with categorical features
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)
X[:, [5, 10, 15]] = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=(1000, 3))  # Convert some features to categorical

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a CatBoost Classifier
cat_clf = CatBoostClassifier(
    iterations=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    depth=3,
    cat_features=[5, 10, 15],  # Specify categorical feature indices
    random_seed=42
)
cat_clf.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=(X_test, y_test), verbose=False)

# Make predictions
y_pred = cat_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"CatBoost Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Feature importance
feature_importance = cat_clf.feature_importances_
for i, importance in enumerate(feature_importance):
    print(f"Feature {i+1} importance: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Voting Classifier

The Voting Classifier is an ensemble method that combines multiple models by aggregating their predictions. It can use either hard voting (majority vote) or soft voting (weighted average of probabilities). This method is particularly useful when you have several well-performing models with different strengths, as it can leverage the diversity of these models to make more robust predictions.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create base models
log_clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
svm_clf = SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)

# Create voting classifier
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('lr', log_clf), ('dt', tree_clf), ('svc', svm_clf)],
    voting='soft'
)

# Train the voting classifier
voting_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = voting_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Voting Classifier Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Compare with individual model performances
for clf, label in zip([log_clf, tree_clf, svm_clf, voting_clf], 
                      ['Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'SVM', 'Voting Classifier']):
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    print(f"{label} Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

Ensemble methods are widely used in image classification tasks. For instance, in a medical imaging application to detect diseases from X-ray images, multiple models can be combined to improve accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
import numpy as np

# Simulated X-ray image features (flatten images to 1D arrays)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 784)  # 1000 images, 28x28 pixels
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Binary classification: 0 (healthy), 1 (disease)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train individual models
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
svm_clf = SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)

models = [rf_clf, gb_clf, svm_clf]
for model in models:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Ensemble prediction
def ensemble_predict(X):
    predictions = np.array([model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1] for model in models])
    return (np.mean(predictions, axis=0) > 0.5).astype(int)

# Evaluate ensemble
y_pred = ensemble_predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Ensemble Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Weather Forecasting

Ensemble methods are crucial in weather forecasting, where multiple models are combined to improve prediction accuracy. This example demonstrates a simplified ensemble approach for temperature prediction.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic weather data
np.random.seed(42)
days = np.arange(365)
temperature = 20 + 15 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * days / 365) + np.random.normal(0, 5, 365)
features = np.column_stack([days, np.sin(2 * np.pi * days / 365), np.cos(2 * np.pi * days / 365)])

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, temperature, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train individual models
rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
lr_reg = LinearRegression()
svr_reg = SVR(kernel='rbf')

models = [rf_reg, lr_reg, svr_reg]
for model in models:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Ensemble prediction
def ensemble_predict(X):
    predictions = np.array([model.predict(X) for model in models])
    return np.mean(predictions, axis=0)

# Evaluate ensemble
y_pred = ensemble_predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Ensemble Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], y_test, color='blue', label='Actual', alpha=0.5)
plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted', alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Day of Year')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.title('Weather Forecasting: Actual vs Predicted Temperature')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
