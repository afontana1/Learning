## Model Evaluation and Refinement with Python
Slide 1: Model Evaluation and Refinement with Python

Model evaluation and refinement are crucial steps in the machine learning pipeline. They help us assess the performance of our models and improve them iteratively. In this slideshow, we'll explore various techniques using Python to evaluate and refine machine learning models.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load and prepare data
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

Slide 2: Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data. It involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets, and validating it on others. This process is repeated multiple times to get a robust estimate of the model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {cv_scores.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Standard deviation of CV scores: {cv_scores.std():.2f}")
```

Slide 3: Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, broken down by class. This helps us understand where our model is making mistakes and identify potential areas for improvement.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: ROC Curve and AUC

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) are useful metrics for evaluating binary classification models. The ROC curve shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate, while AUC provides a single score that summarizes the model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

# Get predicted probabilities
y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Calculate ROC curve and AUC
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_pred_proba)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

# Plot ROC curve
plt.figure()
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (AUC = {roc_auc:.2f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Feature Importance

Understanding which features are most important for making predictions can help us refine our model and gain insights into the problem. Many models, such as Random Forests, provide built-in feature importance scores.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get feature importances
importances = model.feature_importances_
feature_names = X.columns

# Sort features by importance
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title("Feature Importances")
plt.bar(range(X.shape[1]), importances[indices])
plt.xticks(range(X.shape[1]), [feature_names[i] for i in indices], rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best combination of hyperparameters for a model. Grid search is a technique that exhaustively searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter values to find the best combination.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print best parameters and score
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best cross-validation score: {grid_search.best_score_:.2f}")
```

Slide 7: Learning Curves

Learning curves help us understand how model performance changes as we increase the amount of training data. They can reveal whether our model is overfitting or underfitting, and whether collecting more data might help improve performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve

# Generate learning curve data
train_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(
    model, X, y, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10))

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
train_scores_mean = np.mean(train_scores, axis=1)
train_scores_std = np.std(train_scores, axis=1)
test_scores_mean = np.mean(test_scores, axis=1)
test_scores_std = np.std(test_scores, axis=1)

# Plot learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title("Learning Curves")
plt.xlabel("Training examples")
plt.ylabel("Score")
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, train_scores_mean - train_scores_std, train_scores_mean + train_scores_std, alpha=0.1, color="r")
plt.fill_between(train_sizes, test_scores_mean - test_scores_std, test_scores_mean + test_scores_std, alpha=0.1, color="g")
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores_mean, 'o-', color="r", label="Training score")
plt.plot(train_sizes, test_scores_mean, 'o-', color="g", label="Cross-validation score")
plt.legend(loc="best")
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Model Comparison

When working on a machine learning problem, it's often useful to compare multiple models to find the best one for your specific task. We can use cross-validation to compare the performance of different models.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Define models to compare
models = {
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42),
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(random_state=42),
    'SVM': SVC(random_state=42),
    'KNN': KNeighborsClassifier()
}

# Compare models using cross-validation
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f"{name} - Mean CV score: {scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.2f})")
```

Slide 9: Feature Selection

Feature selection is the process of choosing the most relevant features for our model. This can help improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and make the model more interpretable. We'll use recursive feature elimination (RFE) as an example.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

# Create a base model
base_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Perform recursive feature elimination
rfe = RFE(estimator=base_model, n_features_to_select=5)
rfe = rfe.fit(X, y)

# Print selected features
selected_features = X.columns[rfe.support_]
print("Selected features:")
for feature in selected_features:
    print(feature)
```

Slide 10: Handling Imbalanced Data

Imbalanced datasets, where one class is much more prevalent than others, can lead to biased models. We can use techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address this issue. Here's an example using the SMOTE algorithm for oversampling.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from collections import Counter

# Check class distribution
print("Original class distribution:", Counter(y))

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Check new class distribution
print("Resampled class distribution:", Counter(y_resampled))

# Train and evaluate model on resampled data
model_resampled = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
cv_scores_resampled = cross_val_score(model_resampled, X_resampled, y_resampled, cv=5)
print(f"Mean CV score after resampling: {cv_scores_resampled.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Model Interpretability with SHAP

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values help us understand how each feature contributes to a model's predictions. This is particularly useful for complex models like Random Forests or Neural Networks.

```python
import shap

# Create a SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)

# Calculate SHAP values
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Plot summary of SHAP values
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test, plot_type="bar")
```

Slide 12: Cross-Validation with Time Series Data

When working with time series data, we need to use special cross-validation techniques to respect the temporal order of our data. Here's an example using time series split.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Create time series data (example)
dates = pd.date_range(start='2020-01-01', end='2022-12-31', freq='D')
X = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'feature': np.random.randn(len(dates))})
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=len(dates))

# Create TimeSeriesSplit object
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Perform time series cross-validation
for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    # Train and evaluate model (example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train[['feature']], y_train)
    score = model.score(X_test[['feature']], y_test)
    print(f"Test score: {score:.2f}")
```

Slide 13: Model Deployment and Monitoring

After refining our model, it's important to deploy it and monitor its performance in real-world conditions. Here's a simple example of how to save a trained model and load it for predictions.

```python
import joblib

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'trained_model.joblib')

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = joblib.load('trained_model.joblib')

# Make predictions with the loaded model
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'feature1': [1, 2, 3], 'feature2': [4, 5, 6]})
predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
print("Predictions:", predictions)

# Monitor model performance (example)
def monitor_performance(model, X, y, window_size=1000):
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y, predictions)
    print(f"Current model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
    
    # Check for drift (example: if accuracy drops below a threshold)
    if accuracy < 0.8:
        print("Warning: Model performance has degraded. Consider retraining.")
```
