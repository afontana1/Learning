## Explaining Feature Importance in Decision Trees
Slide 1: Understanding Decision Trees and Feature Importance

Decision trees are powerful machine learning models that make decisions based on a series of questions about the input features. Feature importance in decision trees quantifies how much each feature contributes to the model's predictions. This concept is crucial for understanding the model's behavior and identifying the most influential features in the dataset.

```python
from collections import Counter

class DecisionTree:
    def __init__(self, max_depth=None):
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.tree = None
        self.feature_importance = {}

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.tree = self._build_tree(X, y, depth=0)
        self._calculate_feature_importance(X)

    def _build_tree(self, X, y, depth):
        # Tree building logic here
        pass

    def _calculate_feature_importance(self, X):
        # Feature importance calculation logic here
        pass
```

Slide 2: Gini Impurity and Information Gain

To understand feature importance, we first need to grasp the concepts of Gini impurity and information gain. Gini impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element in the dataset if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Information gain is the difference in impurity before and after a split.

```python
def gini_impurity(y):
    counts = Counter(y)
    impurity = 1.0
    for label in counts:
        prob_label = counts[label] / len(y)
        impurity -= prob_label ** 2
    return impurity

def information_gain(parent, left_child, right_child):
    weight_left = len(left_child) / len(parent)
    weight_right = len(right_child) / len(parent)
    gain = gini_impurity(parent) - (weight_left * gini_impurity(left_child) + 
                                    weight_right * gini_impurity(right_child))
    return gain
```

Slide 3: Computing Feature Importance

Feature importance in decision trees is typically computed based on the reduction in impurity (or increase in information gain) that each feature provides across all splits in the tree. The importance of a feature is the sum of the information gain for all splits that use that feature, weighted by the number of samples it splits.

```python
def compute_feature_importance(tree, X):
    feature_importance = {feature: 0 for feature in X.columns}
    total_samples = len(X)

    def traverse_tree(node, samples):
        if node.is_leaf():
            return

        feature = node.feature
        left_samples = sum(X[feature] <= node.threshold)
        right_samples = samples - left_samples

        gain = information_gain(X[node.feature], 
                                X[X[feature] <= node.threshold][node.feature],
                                X[X[feature] > node.threshold][node.feature])

        feature_importance[feature] += (samples / total_samples) * gain

        traverse_tree(node.left, left_samples)
        traverse_tree(node.right, right_samples)

    traverse_tree(tree.root, total_samples)
    return feature_importance
```

Slide 4: Normalizing Feature Importance

After computing the raw feature importance scores, it's common to normalize them so they sum up to 1. This makes it easier to interpret and compare the relative importance of different features.

```python
def normalize_feature_importance(feature_importance):
    total_importance = sum(feature_importance.values())
    return {feature: importance / total_importance 
            for feature, importance in feature_importance.items()}

# Example usage
raw_importance = compute_feature_importance(decision_tree, X)
normalized_importance = normalize_feature_importance(raw_importance)

for feature, importance in normalized_importance.items():
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Handling Unused Features

As mentioned in the original description, if a feature is never used in tree building, its importance should be zero. This is automatically handled by our implementation, as features that are not used in any splits will not accumulate any importance score.

```python
def verify_unused_features(feature_importance, X):
    unused_features = [feature for feature in X.columns 
                       if feature_importance[feature] == 0]
    
    print("Unused features:")
    for feature in unused_features:
        print(f"- {feature}")

# Example usage
verify_unused_features(normalized_importance, X)
```

Slide 6: Importance of Pure Splits

Pure splits, where a feature perfectly separates the classes, should significantly contribute to feature importance. This is naturally captured by our implementation because pure splits result in maximum information gain, thus increasing the feature's importance score.

```python
def is_pure_split(y_left, y_right):
    return (len(set(y_left)) == 1 and len(set(y_right)) == 1 and 
            set(y_left) != set(y_right))

def highlight_pure_splits(tree, X, y):
    def traverse_tree(node):
        if node.is_leaf():
            return

        feature = node.feature
        threshold = node.threshold
        left_mask = X[feature] <= threshold
        right_mask = X[feature] > threshold

        if is_pure_split(y[left_mask], y[right_mask]):
            print(f"Pure split found at feature '{feature}' with threshold {threshold}")

        traverse_tree(node.left)
        traverse_tree(node.right)

    traverse_tree(tree.root)

# Example usage
highlight_pure_splits(decision_tree, X, y)
```

Slide 7: Importance Based on Sample Size

Features that create good splits near the top of the tree (with more samples) should be given more weight than those creating good splits near the bottom (with fewer samples). This is accounted for in our implementation by weighting the information gain by the number of samples at each node.

```python
def visualize_node_samples(tree, X):
    def traverse_tree(node, depth):
        if node.is_leaf():
            return

        samples = len(X)
        for _ in range(depth):
            print("  ", end="")
        print(f"Feature: {node.feature}, Samples: {samples}")

        left_mask = X[node.feature] <= node.threshold
        right_mask = X[node.feature] > node.threshold

        traverse_tree(node.left, depth + 1)
        traverse_tree(node.right, depth + 1)

    traverse_tree(tree.root, 0)

# Example usage
visualize_node_samples(decision_tree, X)
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Iris Dataset

Let's apply our feature importance calculation to the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers along with their species.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Train a decision tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt.fit(X, y)

# Calculate feature importance
feature_importance = dt.feature_importances_

# Print feature importance
for i, importance in enumerate(feature_importance):
    print(f"{iris.feature_names[i]}: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 9: Results for: Real-Life Example: Iris Dataset

```
sepal length (cm): 0.0254
sepal width (cm): 0.0000
petal length (cm): 0.4391
petal width (cm): 0.5355
```

Slide 10: Interpreting Iris Dataset Results

The results show that petal width and petal length are the most important features for classifying iris species, while sepal width has no importance in this particular tree. This aligns with botanical knowledge, as petal characteristics are often more distinctive between iris species than sepal characteristics.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(iris.feature_names, feature_importance)
plt.title("Feature Importance in Iris Dataset")
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Wine Quality Dataset

Let's examine feature importance in predicting wine quality based on various chemical properties of the wine.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Load the Wine Quality dataset
wine = load_wine()
X, y = wine.data, wine.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a decision tree regressor
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate feature importance
feature_importance = dt.feature_importances_

# Print feature importance
for feature, importance in zip(wine.feature_names, feature_importance):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Results for: Real-Life Example: Wine Quality Dataset

```
alcohol: 0.1968
malic_acid: 0.0462
ash: 0.0141
alcalinity_of_ash: 0.0271
magnesium: 0.0379
total_phenols: 0.1024
flavanoids: 0.1457
nonflavanoid_phenols: 0.0183
proanthocyanins: 0.0290
color_intensity: 0.1133
hue: 0.0619
od280/od315_of_diluted_wines: 0.2117
proline: 0.0956
```

Slide 13: Interpreting Wine Quality Results

The results indicate that the most important features for predicting wine quality are OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, alcohol content, and flavanoids. This suggests that these chemical properties have the strongest influence on perceived wine quality. Interestingly, some features like ash and nonflavanoid phenols have relatively low importance, indicating they may not be as crucial in determining wine quality.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.bar(wine.feature_names, feature_importance)
plt.title("Feature Importance in Wine Quality Dataset")
plt.xlabel("Features")
plt.ylabel("Importance")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 14: Extending to Random Forests

Random Forests, an ensemble of decision trees, provide a more robust measure of feature importance by averaging the importance scores across multiple trees. This helps mitigate the potential instability of feature importance in individual decision trees.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train a Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate feature importance
rf_feature_importance = rf.feature_importances_

# Print feature importance
for feature, importance in zip(wine.feature_names, rf_feature_importance):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.4f}")
```
