## Correlation vs Causation Avoiding Misinterpretations

Slide 1: Understanding Covariance and Correlation

Covariance and correlation are statistical measures that describe the relationship between two variables. While they're related concepts, they have distinct meanings and applications.

```python
import random

# Generate random data for two variables
x = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(50)]
y = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(50)]

# Calculate means
mean_x = sum(x) / len(x)
mean_y = sum(y) / len(y)

# Calculate covariance
covariance = sum((x[i] - mean_x) * (y[i] - mean_y) for i in range(len(x))) / (len(x) - 1)

print(f"Covariance: {covariance:.2f}")
```

Slide 2: Covariance Explained

Covariance measures how two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance suggests they move in opposite directions.

```python
def calculate_covariance(x, y):
    if len(x) != len(y):
        raise ValueError("Input lists must have the same length")
    
    n = len(x)
    mean_x = sum(x) / n
    mean_y = sum(y) / n
    
    covariance = sum((x[i] - mean_x) * (y[i] - mean_y) for i in range(n)) / (n - 1)
    return covariance

# Example usage
height = [160, 170, 180, 165, 175]
weight = [60, 70, 80, 65, 75]

cov = calculate_covariance(height, weight)
print(f"Covariance between height and weight: {cov:.2f}")
```

Slide 3: Correlation Coefficient

The correlation coefficient, often denoted as r, is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1.

```python
import math

def calculate_correlation(x, y):
    covariance = calculate_covariance(x, y)
    std_dev_x = math.sqrt(calculate_covariance(x, x))
    std_dev_y = math.sqrt(calculate_covariance(y, y))
    
    correlation = covariance / (std_dev_x * std_dev_y)
    return correlation

# Using the same height and weight data
correlation = calculate_correlation(height, weight)
print(f"Correlation between height and weight: {correlation:.2f}")
```

Slide 4: Interpreting Correlation Coefficients

The correlation coefficient provides information about both the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. Here's how to interpret it:

```python
def interpret_correlation(r):
    if r == 1:
        return "Perfect positive correlation"
    elif r > 0.7:
        return "Strong positive correlation"
    elif r > 0.3:
        return "Moderate positive correlation"
    elif r > 0:
        return "Weak positive correlation"
    elif r == 0:
        return "No linear correlation"
    elif r > -0.3:
        return "Weak negative correlation"
    elif r > -0.7:
        return "Moderate negative correlation"
    elif r > -1:
        return "Strong negative correlation"
    else:
        return "Perfect negative correlation"

# Example usage
r_values = [0.95, -0.5, 0.1, -0.85, 0]
for r in r_values:
    print(f"r = {r}: {interpret_correlation(r)}")
```

Slide 5: Significance of Correlation Coefficients

The significance of a correlation coefficient depends on the sample size and the desired confidence level. We can calculate the t-statistic to determine if the correlation is statistically significant.

```python
import math

def correlation_significance(r, n, alpha=0.05):
    df = n - 2  # degrees of freedom
    t = r * math.sqrt(df / (1 - r**2))
    
    # Critical t-value for two-tailed test
    if df <= 30:
        # Approximation for small sample sizes
        critical_t = 2.0 + 2.0 / math.sqrt(df)
    else:
        # Approximation for large sample sizes
        critical_t = 1.96 + 2.0 / math.sqrt(df)
    
    is_significant = abs(t) > critical_t
    return is_significant, t

# Example usage
r = 0.7
n = 25
significant, t_stat = correlation_significance(r, n)
print(f"Correlation: {r:.2f}")
print(f"Sample size: {n}")
print(f"t-statistic: {t_stat:.2f}")
print(f"Statistically significant: {significant}")
```

Slide 6: Correlation vs. Causation

While correlation measures the strength of a relationship between variables, it does not imply causation. This distinction is crucial in data analysis and scientific research.

```python
import random

def spurious_correlation():
    # Generate random data for ice cream sales and shark attacks
    ice_cream_sales = [random.uniform(1000, 5000) for _ in range(100)]
    shark_attacks = [random.uniform(0, 10) for _ in range(100)]
    
    # Introduce a confounding factor: temperature
    temperature = [random.uniform(15, 35) for _ in range(100)]
    
    # Adjust ice cream sales and shark attacks based on temperature
    ice_cream_sales = [sales * (1 + 0.05 * (temp - 25)) for sales, temp in zip(ice_cream_sales, temperature)]
    shark_attacks = [attacks * (1 + 0.03 * (temp - 25)) for attacks, temp in zip(shark_attacks, temperature)]
    
    correlation = calculate_correlation(ice_cream_sales, shark_attacks)
    return correlation

spurious_r = spurious_correlation()
print(f"Spurious correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks: {spurious_r:.2f}")
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Correlation Without Causation

Consider the relationship between the number of firefighters at a fire scene and the amount of damage caused by the fire. There's often a positive correlation, but more firefighters don't cause more damage.

```python
import random

def fire_damage_simulation(num_simulations=1000):
    correlations = []
    
    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        fire_severity = [random.uniform(1, 10) for _ in range(50)]
        num_firefighters = [max(1, severity * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)) for severity in fire_severity]
        damage = [severity * random.uniform(0.9, 1.1) for severity in fire_severity]
        
        correlation = calculate_correlation(num_firefighters, damage)
        correlations.append(correlation)
    
    avg_correlation = sum(correlations) / len(correlations)
    return avg_correlation

avg_r = fire_damage_simulation()
print(f"Average correlation between number of firefighters and fire damage: {avg_r:.2f}")
```

Slide 8: Identifying Causation

To establish causation, we need more than just correlation. Randomized controlled trials, experimental designs, and causal inference techniques are used to determine causal relationships.

```python
def simulate_ab_test(sample_size=1000):
    # Simulate an A/B test for a website redesign
    control_group = [random.uniform(0, 100) for _ in range(sample_size)]
    treatment_group = [x + random.uniform(5, 15) for x in control_group]  # Assume positive effect
    
    control_mean = sum(control_group) / len(control_group)
    treatment_mean = sum(treatment_group) / len(treatment_group)
    
    effect_size = treatment_mean - control_mean
    
    return control_mean, treatment_mean, effect_size

control_avg, treatment_avg, effect = simulate_ab_test()
print(f"Control group average: {control_avg:.2f}")
print(f"Treatment group average: {treatment_avg:.2f}")
print(f"Estimated causal effect: {effect:.2f}")
```

Slide 9: Confounding Variables

Confounding variables can create the illusion of a causal relationship or mask a true causal relationship. Identifying and controlling for confounders is crucial in establishing causation.

```python
def simulate_confounding(sample_size=1000):
    # Simulate the effect of exercise on health, with age as a confounder
    age = [random.uniform(20, 70) for _ in range(sample_size)]
    
    # Exercise level influenced by age
    exercise = [max(0, 100 - a + random.uniform(-10, 10)) for a in age]
    
    # Health score influenced by both age and exercise
    health = [100 - 0.5*a + 0.3*e + random.uniform(-5, 5) for a, e in zip(age, exercise)]
    
    # Calculate correlations
    corr_exercise_health = calculate_correlation(exercise, health)
    corr_age_health = calculate_correlation(age, health)
    
    return corr_exercise_health, corr_age_health

exercise_health_corr, age_health_corr = simulate_confounding()
print(f"Correlation between exercise and health: {exercise_health_corr:.2f}")
print(f"Correlation between age and health: {age_health_corr:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Causal Inference Techniques

Various techniques have been developed to infer causality from observational data, including propensity score matching, instrumental variables, and difference-in-differences analysis.

```python
def propensity_score_matching(treatment, outcome, covariates):
    # Simplified propensity score matching
    def calculate_propensity_score(x):
        return sum(x) / len(x)  # Simplified score calculation
    
    propensity_scores = [calculate_propensity_score(cov) for cov in covariates]
    
    matched_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(treatment)):
        if treatment[i] == 1:
            best_match = min((j for j in range(len(treatment)) if treatment[j] == 0), 
                             key=lambda j: abs(propensity_scores[i] - propensity_scores[j]))
            matched_pairs.append((i, best_match))
    
    treatment_effect = sum(outcome[i] - outcome[j] for i, j in matched_pairs) / len(matched_pairs)
    return treatment_effect

# Example usage
treatment = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
outcome = [10, 8, 12, 7, 11, 9, 13, 8]
covariates = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [1, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [2, 1, 3], [2, 2, 2]]

effect = propensity_score_matching(treatment, outcome, covariates)
print(f"Estimated causal effect: {effect:.2f}")
```

Slide 11: Granger Causality

Granger causality is a statistical concept used to determine whether one time series can be used to forecast another. It's often used in economics and neuroscience.

```python
def granger_causality(x, y, max_lag=5):
    n = len(x)
    
    def auto_regression(y, lags):
        X = [y[i:n-lags+i] for i in range(lags)]
        X = [[1] + [x[i] for x in X] for i in range(n-lags)]
        Y = y[lags:]
        
        # Simplified OLS estimation
        XTX = [[sum(a*b for a, b in zip(X[i], X[j])) for j in range(len(X[0]))] for i in range(len(X[0]))]
        XTY = [sum(a*b for a, b in zip(X[i], Y)) for i in range(len(X[0]))]
        beta = [sum(a*b for a, b in zip(XTX[i], XTY)) for i in range(len(XTY))]
        
        residuals = [Y[i] - sum(a*b for a, b in zip(X[i], beta)) for i in range(len(Y))]
        RSS = sum(r**2 for r in residuals)
        return RSS
    
    results = []
    for lag in range(1, max_lag + 1):
        rss_restricted = auto_regression(y, lag)
        rss_unrestricted = auto_regression(y + x, lag)
        
        f_statistic = ((rss_restricted - rss_unrestricted) / lag) / (rss_unrestricted / (n - 2*lag - 1))
        results.append((lag, f_statistic))
    
    return results

# Example usage
x = [random.random() for _ in range(100)]
y = [0.7 * x[i-1] + 0.3 * random.random() for i in range(1, 101)]

granger_results = granger_causality(x, y)
for lag, f_stat in granger_results:
    print(f"Lag {lag}: F-statistic = {f_stat:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Causal Diagrams (DAGs)

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are powerful tools for visualizing and analyzing causal relationships. They help identify confounders, mediators, and colliders in causal models.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.parents = []
        self.children = []

class DAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}
    
    def add_node(self, name):
        if name not in self.nodes:
            self.nodes[name] = Node(name)
    
    def add_edge(self, parent, child):
        self.add_node(parent)
        self.add_node(child)
        self.nodes[parent].children.append(self.nodes[child])
        self.nodes[child].parents.append(self.nodes[parent])
    
    def is_confounder(self, node, treatment, outcome):
        return (node in self.nodes[treatment].parents and 
                node in self.nodes[outcome].parents)
    
    def is_mediator(self, node, treatment, outcome):
        return (node in self.nodes[treatment].children and 
                node in self.nodes[outcome].parents)
    
    def is_collider(self, node, var1, var2):
        return (node in self.nodes[var1].children and 
                node in self.nodes[var2].children)

# Example usage
dag = DAG()
dag.add_edge("Age", "Exercise")
dag.add_edge("Age", "Health")
dag.add_edge("Exercise", "Health")
dag.add_edge("Diet", "Exercise")
dag.add_edge("Diet", "Health")

print("Age is a confounder for Exercise -> Health:", 
      dag.is_confounder("Age", "Exercise", "Health"))
print("Exercise is a mediator for Age -> Health:", 
      dag.is_mediator("Exercise", "Age", "Health"))
print("Health is a collider for Exercise <- -> Diet:", 
      dag.is_collider("Health", "Exercise", "Diet"))
```

Slide 13: Limitations and Considerations

While statistical methods can help identify potential causal relationships, they have limitations. Domain knowledge, experimental design, and careful interpretation are crucial for establishing causality.

```python
def simulate_simpson_paradox():
    # Simulate data for a medical treatment
    groups = ['Group A', 'Group B']
    treatments = ['Treatment', 'Control']
    
    data = {
        'Group A': {'Treatment': (81, 87), 'Control': (234, 270)},
        'Group B': {'Treatment': (192, 263), 'Control': (55, 80)}
    }
    
    def calculate_rate(successes, total):
        return successes / total if total > 0 else 0
    
    overall_treatment = sum(data[g]['Treatment'][0] for g in groups), sum(data[g]['Treatment'][1] for g in groups)
    overall_control = sum(data[g]['Control'][0] for g in groups), sum(data[g]['Control'][1] for g in groups)
    
    print("Group-wise comparison:")
    for group in groups:
        t_rate = calculate_rate(*data[group]['Treatment'])
        c_rate = calculate_rate(*data[group]['Control'])
        print(f"{group}: Treatment {t_rate:.2%}, Control {c_rate:.2%}")
    
    print("\nOverall comparison:")
    print(f"Treatment: {calculate_rate(*overall_treatment):.2%}")
    print(f"Control: {calculate_rate(*overall_control):.2%}")

simulate_simpson_paradox()
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Sleep and Academic Performance

Let's explore the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, considering the potential confounding effect of stress.

```python
import random

def simulate_sleep_study(n_students=1000):
    # Simulate student data
    stress_levels = [random.uniform(1, 10) for _ in range(n_students)]
    sleep_hours = [max(4, min(10, 8 - 0.3 * stress + random.uniform(-1, 1))) for stress in stress_levels]
    grades = [min(100, max(0, 70 + 2 * sleep - 1.5 * stress + random.uniform(-5, 5))) 
              for sleep, stress in zip(sleep_hours, stress_levels)]
    
    # Calculate correlations
    sleep_grade_corr = calculate_correlation(sleep_hours, grades)
    stress_grade_corr = calculate_correlation(stress_levels, grades)
    stress_sleep_corr = calculate_correlation(stress_levels, sleep_hours)
    
    print(f"Correlation between sleep and grades: {sleep_grade_corr:.2f}")
    print(f"Correlation between stress and grades: {stress_grade_corr:.2f}")
    print(f"Correlation between stress and sleep: {stress_sleep_corr:.2f}")

simulate_sleep_study()
```

Slide 15: Conclusion and Best Practices

To navigate the complex relationship between correlation and causation:

1.  Always consider alternative explanations for observed correlations.
2.  Use multiple methods to strengthen causal inferences.
3.  Be aware of potential confounding variables.
4.  Design experiments or observational studies carefully.
5.  Interpret results cautiously, especially in observational studies.

```python
def causal_inference_checklist(observed_correlation, 
                               alternative_explanations,
                               confounders_controlled,
                               experimental_design,
                               replication_studies):
    score = 0
    max_score = 5
    
    if observed_correlation > 0.5:
        score += 1
    if len(alternative_explanations) == 0:
        score += 1
    if confounders_controlled:
        score += 1
    if experimental_design == "randomized controlled trial":
        score += 1
    if replication_studies > 0:
        score += 1
    
    confidence = score / max_score
    return f"Causal inference confidence: {confidence:.2%}"

# Example usage
result = causal_inference_checklist(
    observed_correlation=0.7,
    alternative_explanations=["reverse causality"],
    confounders_controlled=True,
    experimental_design="observational study",
    replication_studies=2
)
print(result)
```
