## Mean Centering and Min-Max Normalization for User Ratings
Slide 1: Introduction to Data Normalization

Data normalization is a crucial preprocessing step in many machine learning and data analysis tasks. It helps to bring different features or variables to a common scale, which can improve the performance and convergence of various algorithms. In this presentation, we'll focus on two popular normalization techniques: mean centering and min-max scaling, specifically in the context of user ratings.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample user ratings data
ratings = np.array([3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 5])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings)), ratings)
plt.title("Original Ratings")
plt.subplot(122)
plt.hist(ratings, bins=5)
plt.title("Distribution of Ratings")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Mean Centering: Concept and Implementation

Mean centering is a normalization technique that subtracts the mean value of a dataset from each data point. This process shifts the distribution of the data to have a mean of zero. For user ratings, mean centering can help remove bias and highlight deviations from the average rating.

```python
def mean_center(data):
    return data - np.mean(data)

centered_ratings = mean_center(ratings)

print("Original ratings:", ratings)
print("Centered ratings:", centered_ratings)
print("Mean of centered ratings:", np.mean(centered_ratings))
```

Slide 3: Visualizing Mean Centered Data

Let's visualize the effect of mean centering on our user ratings data. We'll create a bar plot comparing the original ratings to the mean-centered ratings.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings)), ratings)
plt.title("Original Ratings")
plt.ylim(0, 6)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.bar(range(len(centered_ratings)), centered_ratings)
plt.title("Mean Centered Ratings")
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='-')
plt.ylim(-3, 3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Min-Max Scaling: Concept and Implementation

Min-max scaling, also known as normalization, is a technique that scales the data to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1. This method preserves the relative differences between data points while bringing them to a common scale. For user ratings, min-max scaling can be useful when you want to maintain the proportional differences between ratings.

```python
def min_max_scale(data):
    return (data - np.min(data)) / (np.max(data) - np.min(data))

scaled_ratings = min_max_scale(ratings)

print("Original ratings:", ratings)
print("Min-max scaled ratings:", scaled_ratings)
print("Min of scaled ratings:", np.min(scaled_ratings))
print("Max of scaled ratings:", np.max(scaled_ratings))
```

Slide 5: Visualizing Min-Max Scaled Data

Now, let's visualize the effect of min-max scaling on our user ratings data. We'll create a bar plot comparing the original ratings to the min-max scaled ratings.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings)), ratings)
plt.title("Original Ratings")
plt.ylim(0, 6)
plt.subplot(122)
plt.bar(range(len(scaled_ratings)), scaled_ratings)
plt.title("Min-Max Scaled Ratings")
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Comparing Mean Centering and Min-Max Scaling

Let's compare the effects of mean centering and min-max scaling on the same dataset. This comparison will help us understand the differences between these two normalization techniques and their impact on the data distribution.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
plt.subplot(131)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings)), ratings)
plt.title("Original Ratings")
plt.ylim(0, 6)
plt.subplot(132)
plt.bar(range(len(centered_ratings)), centered_ratings)
plt.title("Mean Centered Ratings")
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='-')
plt.ylim(-3, 3)
plt.subplot(133)
plt.bar(range(len(scaled_ratings)), scaled_ratings)
plt.title("Min-Max Scaled Ratings")
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Movie Ratings

Consider a movie recommendation system that uses user ratings. We'll demonstrate how mean centering and min-max scaling can be applied to a dataset of movie ratings.

```python
# Sample movie ratings from multiple users
movie_ratings = np.array([
    [4, 3, 5, 2, 1],  # User 1
    [3, 4, 3, 1, 2],  # User 2
    [5, 5, 5, 3, 4],  # User 3
    [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]   # User 4
])

print("Original movie ratings:")
print(movie_ratings)

# Apply mean centering
centered_movie_ratings = np.apply_along_axis(mean_center, 1, movie_ratings)
print("\nMean centered movie ratings:")
print(centered_movie_ratings)

# Apply min-max scaling
scaled_movie_ratings = np.apply_along_axis(min_max_scale, 1, movie_ratings)
print("\nMin-max scaled movie ratings:")
print(scaled_movie_ratings)
```

Slide 8: Interpreting Normalized Movie Ratings

Let's interpret the results of our movie ratings normalization. Mean centering helps identify which movies each user rated above or below their average rating. Min-max scaling shows the relative preference of each user for the movies they've rated.

```python
def interpret_ratings(original, centered, scaled):
    for i, (orig, cent, scale) in enumerate(zip(original, centered, scaled)):
        print(f"User {i+1}:")
        print(f"  Original ratings: {orig}")
        print(f"  Centered ratings: {cent}")
        print(f"  Scaled ratings:   {scale}")
        print(f"  Interpretation:")
        print(f"    - Highest rated movie: {np.argmax(orig) + 1}")
        print(f"    - Lowest rated movie:  {np.argmin(orig) + 1}")
        print(f"    - Movies above average: {np.where(cent > 0)[0] + 1}")
        print(f"    - Movies below average: {np.where(cent < 0)[0] + 1}")
        print()

interpret_ratings(movie_ratings, centered_movie_ratings, scaled_movie_ratings)
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Product Reviews

Consider an e-commerce platform that collects product reviews. We'll demonstrate how normalization techniques can be applied to analyze customer satisfaction across different product categories.

```python
# Sample product ratings for different categories
categories = ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Books', 'Home & Kitchen']
product_ratings = np.array([
    [4.2, 3.8, 4.5, 4.0],  # Category averages
    [0.8, 1.0, 0.5, 0.7]   # Standard deviations
])

def generate_ratings(mean, std, num_ratings=1000):
    return np.clip(np.random.normal(mean, std, num_ratings), 1, 5)

category_ratings = [generate_ratings(m, s) for m, s in zip(product_ratings[0], product_ratings[1])]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.boxplot(category_ratings, labels=categories)
plt.title("Product Ratings by Category")
plt.ylabel("Rating")
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Normalizing Product Ratings

We'll apply mean centering and min-max scaling to the product ratings to compare customer satisfaction across categories, accounting for different rating scales and biases.

```python
# Calculate overall mean and range
overall_mean = np.mean([np.mean(ratings) for ratings in category_ratings])
overall_min = min([np.min(ratings) for ratings in category_ratings])
overall_max = max([np.max(ratings) for ratings in category_ratings])

# Apply normalization
centered_category_ratings = [ratings - np.mean(ratings) + overall_mean for ratings in category_ratings]
scaled_category_ratings = [(ratings - overall_min) / (overall_max - overall_min) for ratings in category_ratings]

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
plt.subplot(131)
plt.boxplot(category_ratings, labels=categories)
plt.title("Original Ratings")
plt.subplot(132)
plt.boxplot(centered_category_ratings, labels=categories)
plt.title("Mean Centered Ratings")
plt.subplot(133)
plt.boxplot(scaled_category_ratings, labels=categories)
plt.title("Min-Max Scaled Ratings")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: Interpreting Normalized Product Ratings

Let's interpret the results of our product ratings normalization. This analysis can help identify categories that perform better or worse than others, accounting for different rating behaviors across categories.

```python
def interpret_product_ratings(original, centered, scaled):
    for i, category in enumerate(categories):
        orig_mean = np.mean(original[i])
        cent_mean = np.mean(centered[i])
        scale_mean = np.mean(scaled[i])
        
        print(f"{category}:")
        print(f"  Original mean: {orig_mean:.2f}")
        print(f"  Centered mean: {cent_mean:.2f}")
        print(f"  Scaled mean:   {scale_mean:.2f}")
        print(f"  Interpretation:")
        print(f"    - {'Above' if cent_mean > overall_mean else 'Below'} overall average")
        print(f"    - Relative satisfaction: {scale_mean:.2%}")
        print()

interpret_product_ratings(category_ratings, centered_category_ratings, scaled_category_ratings)
```

Slide 12: Choosing Between Mean Centering and Min-Max Scaling

The choice between mean centering and min-max scaling depends on your specific use case and the characteristics of your data. Here are some considerations:

Mean Centering:

* Preserves the spread of the data
* Useful for highlighting deviations from the mean
* Maintains the unit of measurement
* Can handle negative values

Min-Max Scaling:

* Bounds the data within a specific range (usually \[0, 1\])
* Preserves zero values
* Useful when you need a bounded range for your algorithm
* Can be sensitive to outliers

Slide 14: Choosing Between Mean Centering and Min-Max Scaling

```python
# Demonstrating the effect of outliers on min-max scaling
ratings_with_outlier = np.append(ratings, [10])  # Adding an outlier

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
plt.subplot(121)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings_with_outlier)), min_max_scale(ratings_with_outlier))
plt.title("Min-Max Scaled (With Outlier)")
plt.subplot(122)
plt.bar(range(len(ratings_with_outlier)), mean_center(ratings_with_outlier))
plt.title("Mean Centered (With Outlier)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 15: Practical Tips for Normalizing User Ratings

1. Consider the distribution of your data before choosing a normalization technique.
2. Be aware of the impact of outliers, especially when using min-max scaling.
3. For user ratings, mean centering can help remove individual user biases.
4. Min-max scaling can be useful when you need to compare ratings across different scales.
5. Always validate your normalization results and their impact on your specific application.

Slide 16: Practical Tips for Normalizing User Ratings

```python
# Demonstrating the impact of normalization on a machine learning model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 10  # Features
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 10).astype(int)  # Target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train and evaluate without normalization
model_raw = LogisticRegression()
model_raw.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_raw = model_raw.predict(X_test)
accuracy_raw = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_raw)

# Train and evaluate with min-max scaling
X_train_scaled = min_max_scale(X_train)
X_test_scaled = min_max_scale(X_test)
model_scaled = LogisticRegression()
model_scaled.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
y_pred_scaled = model_scaled.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy_scaled = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_scaled)

print(f"Accuracy without normalization: {accuracy_raw:.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy with min-max scaling: {accuracy_scaled:.4f}")
```
