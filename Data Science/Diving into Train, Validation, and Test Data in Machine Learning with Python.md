## Diving into Train, Validation, and Test Data in Machine Learning with Python
Slide 1: Understanding Train, Validation, and Test Data

In machine learning, the division of data into train, validation, and test sets is crucial for developing robust models. This process helps in training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating performance on unseen data. Let's explore these concepts using Python and the popular scikit-learn library.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 5)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Split data into train+validation and test sets
X_train_val, X_test, y_train_val, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Further split train+validation into train and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train_val, y_train_val, test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

print(f"Train set shape: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Validation set shape: {X_val.shape}")
print(f"Test set shape: {X_test.shape}")
```

Slide 2: Training Data: The Foundation of Learning

Training data is the largest portion of your dataset, used to teach the model patterns and relationships. It's the data on which the model learns and adjusts its parameters. Let's create a simple model and train it on our training data.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize and train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Check training accuracy
train_accuracy = model.score(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 3: Validation Data: Fine-tuning the Model

Validation data is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance during training. Let's use our validation set to evaluate the model and compare it with the training performance.

```python
# Evaluate on validation set
val_accuracy = model.score(X_val, y_val)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {val_accuracy:.4f}")

# Compare with training accuracy
print(f"Difference (Train - Val): {train_accuracy - val_accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Test Data: The Final Evaluation

Test data is kept separate throughout the training process and is used only for the final evaluation of the model. It simulates real-world, unseen data and provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance. Let's evaluate our model on the test set.

```python
# Evaluate on test set
test_accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")

# Compare with validation accuracy
print(f"Difference (Val - Test): {val_accuracy - test_accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Cross-Validation: A Robust Evaluation Technique

Cross-validation is a powerful technique that uses multiple train-validation splits to get a more reliable estimate of model performance. It's particularly useful when you have limited data. Let's implement k-fold cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train_val, y_train_val, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {cv_scores.mean():.4f}")
print(f"Standard deviation: {cv_scores.std():.4f}")
```

Slide 6: Stratified Sampling: Maintaining Class Distribution

When dealing with imbalanced datasets, it's crucial to maintain the class distribution across train, validation, and test sets. Stratified sampling ensures this balance. Let's see how to implement stratified splitting.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit

# Create stratified split
sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Perform the split
for train_index, test_index in sss.split(X, y):
    X_train_val, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train_val, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]

print(f"Train+Val set shape: {X_train_val.shape}")
print(f"Test set shape: {X_test.shape}")

# Check class distribution
print(f"Original class distribution: {np.bincount(y) / len(y)}")
print(f"Train+Val class distribution: {np.bincount(y_train_val) / len(y_train_val)}")
print(f"Test class distribution: {np.bincount(y_test) / len(y_test)}")
```

Slide 7: Time Series Data: Special Considerations

When working with time series data, random splitting can lead to data leakage. Instead, we need to use time-based splitting. Let's create a simple time series dataset and split it appropriately.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Create a time series dataset
dates = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-12-31', freq='D')
X = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'feature': np.random.rand(len(dates))})
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, len(dates))

# Initialize TimeSeriesSplit
tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# Perform the split
for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    print(f"Train set: {X_train.date.min()} to {X_train.date.max()}")
    print(f"Test set: {X_test.date.min()} to {X_test.date.max()}\n")
```

Slide 8: Data Leakage: A Common Pitfall

Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model. This can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates. Let's demonstrate a common form of data leakage and how to avoid it.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Incorrect approach (leakage)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Correct approach (no leakage)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

print("Correct approach: Scaler fitted only on training data")
print(f"Train set mean: {X_train_scaled.mean():.4f}")
print(f"Test set mean: {X_test_scaled.mean():.4f}")
```

Slide 9: Feature Selection: When to Split

Feature selection is an important step in model development, but it's crucial to perform it only on the training data to avoid leakage. Let's demonstrate the correct way to incorporate feature selection in your workflow.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Split the data first
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Perform feature selection on training data only
selector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

print(f"Original feature count: {X_train.shape[1]}")
print(f"Selected feature count: {X_train_selected.shape[1]}")
```

Slide 10: Handling Imbalanced Datasets

Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation can help. Let's explore using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance our dataset.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from collections import Counter

# Create an imbalanced dataset
X_imbalanced = np.random.rand(1000, 5)
y_imbalanced = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000, p=[0.9, 0.1])

print("Original class distribution:", Counter(y_imbalanced))

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_balanced, y_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_imbalanced, y_imbalanced)

print("Balanced class distribution:", Counter(y_balanced))
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Iris Flower Classification

Let's apply our knowledge to a real-world dataset: the Iris flower classification problem. We'll split the data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = SVC(kernel='rbf', random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=iris.target_names))
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Handwritten Digit Recognition

Another practical application is handwritten digit recognition. We'll use the MNIST dataset, prepare the data, and train a simple neural network.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the digits dataset
digits = load_digits()
X, y = digits.data, digits.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 13: Visualizing Data Splits

Visualizing how data is split can provide insights into the distribution across sets. Let's create a simple visualization of our train-validation-test split.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Split data
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Visualize the split
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.scatter(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], c='blue', label='Train', alpha=0.7)
plt.scatter(X_val[:, 0], X_val[:, 1], c='green', label='Validation', alpha=0.7)
plt.scatter(X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c='red', label='Test', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Visualization of Train-Validation-Test Split')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
