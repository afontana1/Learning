## Comparing NLTK and spaCy for NLP in Python
Slide 1: NLTK vs. spaCy: Which NLP Tool Should You Use?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a crucial field in artificial intelligence, and two popular Python libraries for NLP are NLTK and spaCy. This presentation will compare these tools, highlighting their strengths and use cases to help you choose the right one for your project.

```python
import nltk
import spacy

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')

# Load spaCy model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Sample text
text = "NLTK and spaCy are powerful NLP libraries in Python."

# NLTK tokenization
nltk_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)

# spaCy tokenization
spacy_tokens = [token.text for token in nlp(text)]

print("NLTK tokens:", nltk_tokens)
print("spaCy tokens:", spacy_tokens)
```

Slide 2: NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit

NLTK is a comprehensive library for NLP tasks. It provides a wide range of tools and resources for various NLP tasks, including tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK is known for its extensive documentation and educational resources.

```python
from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

text = "The quick brown foxes are jumping over the lazy dogs"

# Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Part-of-speech tagging
pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)

# Stemming
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
stems = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]

print("Tokens:", tokens)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
print("Stems:", stems)
```

Slide 3: spaCy: Industrial-Strength NLP

spaCy is designed for production use, offering fast and efficient NLP processing. It provides pre-trained models for various languages and supports advanced features like named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and word vectors out of the box.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

text = "Apple Inc. is planning to open a new store in New York City next month."

doc = nlp(text)

# Named Entity Recognition
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]

# Dependency Parsing
dependencies = [(token.text, token.dep_, token.head.text) for token in doc]

print("Named Entities:", entities)
print("Dependencies:", dependencies)
```

Slide 4: Performance Comparison

spaCy is generally faster than NLTK, especially for large-scale processing. It uses optimized Cython code and provides efficient data structures. NLTK, while slower, offers more flexibility and a wider range of algorithms.

```python
import time
import nltk
import spacy

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. " * 10000

# NLTK tokenization
start_time = time.time()
nltk_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
nltk_time = time.time() - start_time

# spaCy tokenization
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
start_time = time.time()
spacy_tokens = [token.text for token in nlp(text)]
spacy_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"NLTK tokenization time: {nltk_time:.4f} seconds")
print(f"spaCy tokenization time: {spacy_time:.4f} seconds")
```

Slide 5: Ease of Use and Learning Curve

NLTK has a gentler learning curve and is often used in academic settings. It provides a more intuitive interface for basic NLP tasks. spaCy, while powerful, may require more time to master due to its object-oriented design and advanced features.

```python
# NLTK example: Simple tokenization and POS tagging
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

text = "NLTK is great for learning NLP concepts."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)
print("NLTK:", pos_tags)

# spaCy example: Tokenization and POS tagging
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

doc = nlp("spaCy is powerful for production NLP.")
spacy_pos = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]
print("spaCy:", spacy_pos)
```

Slide 6: Customization and Extensibility

NLTK offers more flexibility in terms of customizing algorithms and implementing new NLP techniques. spaCy, while less flexible, provides a more structured approach to extending its functionality through its pipeline system.

```python
# NLTK: Custom tokenizer
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer

custom_tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+|[^\w\s]+')
text = "Let's create a custom tokenizer!"
tokens = custom_tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print("Custom NLTK tokens:", tokens)

# spaCy: Custom pipeline component
import spacy
from spacy.language import Language

@Language.component("custom_component")
def custom_component(doc):
    for token in doc:
        if token.is_alpha and len(token) > 5:
            token._.is_long_word = True
    return doc

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp.add_pipe("custom_component", last=True)
doc = nlp("This is a demonstration of a custom spaCy component.")
long_words = [token.text for token in doc if token._.get("is_long_word")]
print("Long words:", long_words)
```

Slide 7: Pre-trained Models and Language Support

spaCy excels in providing pre-trained models for various languages, offering out-of-the-box support for multiple NLP tasks. NLTK, while offering resources for many languages, often requires more manual setup and model training.

```python
import spacy

# Load pre-trained models for English and German
nlp_en = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
nlp_de = spacy.load("de_core_news_sm")

en_text = "The cat sits on the mat."
de_text = "Die Katze sitzt auf der Matte."

# Process text in different languages
en_doc = nlp_en(en_text)
de_doc = nlp_de(de_text)

# Named Entity Recognition
print("English NER:", [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in en_doc.ents])
print("German NER:", [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in de_doc.ents])

# Dependency Parsing
print("English Dependencies:", [(token.text, token.dep_) for token in en_doc])
print("German Dependencies:", [(token.text, token.dep_) for token in de_doc])
```

Slide 8: Integration with Deep Learning Frameworks

spaCy provides better integration with modern deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This makes it easier to incorporate neural network models into your NLP pipeline. NLTK, while capable of working with these frameworks, requires more setup and custom code.

```python
import spacy
from spacy.util import minibatch, compounding
from spacy.training import Example

# Load spaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample training data
TRAIN_DATA = [
    ("Uber blew through $1 million a week", {"entities": [(0, 4, "ORG")]}),
    ("Google rebrands its business apps", {"entities": [(0, 6, "ORG")]})]

# Add NER pipe to the model
if "ner" not in nlp.pipe_names:
    ner = nlp.add_pipe("ner")
else:
    ner = nlp.get_pipe("ner")

# Add labels
for _, annotations in TRAIN_DATA:
    for ent in annotations.get("entities"):
        ner.add_label(ent[2])

# Training loop (simplified)
for itn in range(20):
    examples = []
    for text, annots in TRAIN_DATA:
        doc = nlp.make_doc(text)
        example = Example.from_dict(doc, annots)
        examples.append(example)
    nlp.update(examples, drop=0.5)

# Test the model
test_text = "Microsoft announces new cloud services"
doc = nlp(test_text)
print("Entities:", [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents])
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Sentiment Analysis

Let's compare NLTK and spaCy for sentiment analysis, a common NLP task used in social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import spacy
from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob

# NLTK Sentiment Analysis
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# spaCy Sentiment Analysis
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
nlp.add_pipe('spacytextblob')

text = "I love this product! It's amazing and works perfectly."

# NLTK analysis
nltk_sentiment = sia.polarity_scores(text)

# spaCy analysis
doc = nlp(text)
spacy_sentiment = doc._.blob.sentiment.polarity

print("NLTK Sentiment:", nltk_sentiment)
print("spaCy Sentiment:", spacy_sentiment)
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from unstructured text. Let's compare how NLTK and spaCy perform this task on a sample news article.

```python
import nltk
from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk
import spacy

# Sample news article
text = """
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today that it has 
approved a new vaccine developed by researchers at Oxford University. 
The vaccine, which has shown promising results in clinical trials, 
is expected to be distributed globally starting next month.
"""

# NLTK NER
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')
nltk.download('words')
nltk_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
nltk_pos = pos_tag(nltk_tokens)
nltk_ner = ne_chunk(nltk_pos)

# spaCy NER
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp(text)

print("NLTK Named Entities:")
for chunk in nltk_ner:
    if hasattr(chunk, 'label'):
        print(chunk.label(), ' '.join(c[0] for c in chunk))

print("\nspaCy Named Entities:")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.label_, ent.text)
```

Slide 11: When to Choose NLTK

NLTK is an excellent choice for:

1. Academic research and experimentation
2. Learning NLP concepts and algorithms
3. Projects requiring extensive customization of NLP algorithms
4. Tasks that benefit from NLTK's rich corpus and dataset collection

```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')

# Example: Using NLTK for word sense disambiguation and lemmatization
def get_wordnet_pos(word):
    tag = nltk.pos_tag([word])[0][1][0].upper()
    tag_dict = {"J": wordnet.ADJ, "N": wordnet.NOUN, "V": wordnet.VERB, "R": wordnet.ADV}
    return tag_dict.get(tag, wordnet.NOUN)

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
text = "The foxes are running quickly through the forest"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

lemmas = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w, get_wordnet_pos(w)) for w in tokens]
print("Original:", tokens)
print("Lemmatized:", lemmas)

# Word sense disambiguation
for synset in wordnet.synsets("run"):
    print(f"Sense: {synset.name()}, Definition: {synset.definition()}")
```

Slide 12: When to Choose spaCy

spaCy is preferable for:

1. Production environments requiring fast processing
2. Projects needing advanced features like dependency parsing and entity linking
3. Multilingual NLP tasks with pre-trained models
4. Integration with deep learning frameworks and pipelines

```python
import spacy
from spacy import displacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

text = "SpaceX has successfully launched another batch of Starlink satellites into orbit."
doc = nlp(text)

# Named Entity Recognition
print("Named Entities:")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"{ent.text} - {ent.label_}")

# Dependency Parsing
print("\nDependency Parse:")
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text} -- {token.dep_} --> {token.head.text}")

# Visualize the dependency parse (returns HTML)
html = displacy.render(doc, style="dep", options={"compact": True})
print("\nVisualization HTML generated (not displayed here)")

# Word vectors (if using a larger model with vectors)
if doc.has_vector:
    similar_words = nlp.vocab.get_vector("satellite").most_similar(n=5)
    print("\nWords similar to 'satellite':", [w for w, _ in similar_words])
```

Slide 13: Conclusion: Choosing the Right Tool

The choice between NLTK and spaCy depends on your specific needs:

* Use NLTK for research, education, and highly customized NLP tasks.
* Choose spaCy for production environments, speed, and advanced out-of-the-box features.

Consider factors like project requirements, performance needs, and your team's expertise when making your decision.

```python
import nltk
import spacy

text = "Choose the right NLP tool for your project!"

# NLTK processing
nltk_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
nltk_pos = nltk.pos_tag(nltk_tokens)

# spaCy processing
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp(text)
spacy_tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
spacy_pos = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]

print("NLTK Result:", nltk_pos)
print("spaCy Result:", spacy_pos)

# Demonstrate a unique feature of each:
# NLTK: Access to WordNet
from nltk.corpus import wordnet
nltk.download('wordnet')
synonyms = wordnet.synsets("choose")[0].lemmas()
print("NLTK WordNet Synonyms for 'choose':", [s.name() for s in synonyms])

# spaCy: Named Entity Recognition
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
print("spaCy Named Entities:", entities)
```
