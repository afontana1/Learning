## Cross-Validation Techniques in Python for Machine Learning
Slide 1: Introduction to Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a crucial technique in machine learning for assessing model performance and preventing overfitting. It involves partitioning the data into subsets, training the model on a subset, and validating it on the remaining data. This process helps in estimating how well the model will generalize to unseen data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 * X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# Create a model
model = LinearRegression()

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 2: Types of Cross-Validation

There are several types of cross-validation techniques, each suited for different scenarios. The most common types include k-fold cross-validation, stratified k-fold cross-validation, and leave-one-out cross-validation. Each method has its own strengths and is chosen based on the dataset size, class distribution, and computational resources available.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, StratifiedKFold, LeaveOneOut

# K-Fold Cross-Validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
loo = LeaveOneOut()

# Example usage
for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    # Train and evaluate model here
```

Slide 3: K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation divides the dataset into k equally sized subsets or folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The final performance metric is typically the average of all k iterations.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 1).astype(int)

kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
model = LogisticRegression()

accuracies = []

for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"Accuracies: {accuracies}")
print(f"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(accuracies):.2f}")
```

Slide 4: Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a variation of k-fold that ensures each fold has approximately the same proportion of samples for each class as the complete dataset. This method is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets or when the target variable is categorical.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

# Sample imbalanced data
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(80), np.ones(20)])

skf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
model = SVC()

f1_scores = []

for train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    f1_scores.append(f1_score(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"F1 scores: {f1_scores}")
print(f"Mean F1 score: {np.mean(f1_scores):.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation

Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is an extreme case of k-fold cross-validation where k equals the number of samples in the dataset. In each iteration, the model is trained on all but one sample and validated on the left-out sample. While computationally expensive, LOOCV can be useful for small datasets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import LeaveOneOut
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(20, 2)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 1).astype(int)

loo = LeaveOneOut()
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

accuracies = []

for train_index, test_index in loo.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracies.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(accuracies):.2f}")
```

Slide 6: Time Series Cross-Validation

When dealing with time series data, traditional cross-validation methods may lead to data leakage. Time series cross-validation ensures that future data is not used to predict past events. It typically involves using expanding windows or rolling windows for training and validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Generate time series data
X = np.array(range(100)).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.sin(X).ravel() + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)
model = LinearRegression()

mse_scores = []

for train_index, test_index in tscv.split(X):
    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse_scores.append(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"MSE scores: {mse_scores}")
print(f"Mean MSE: {np.mean(mse_scores):.4f}")
```

Slide 7: Cross-Validation with Sklearn Pipeline

Sklearn's Pipeline allows us to combine multiple steps of data preprocessing and model training into a single object. This is particularly useful in cross-validation to ensure that all preprocessing steps are properly included in each fold, preventing data leakage.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load sample data
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('svm', SVC())
])

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 8: Nested Cross-Validation

Nested cross-validation is used when we need to tune hyperparameters and get an unbiased estimate of the model's performance. It involves an outer loop for estimating the model's performance and an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Load sample data
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Create the inner cross-validation
inner_cv = GridSearchCV(SVC(), param_grid, cv=3)

# Perform nested cross-validation
outer_scores = cross_val_score(inner_cv, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Nested CV scores: {outer_scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {outer_scores.mean():.2f}")
```

Slide 9: Cross-Validation for Feature Selection

Cross-validation can be used in feature selection to identify the most important features that generalize well across different subsets of the data. This helps in building more robust and less overfitted models.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=5, random_state=42)

# Create a classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Perform Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation
selector = RFECV(estimator=clf, step=1, cv=5)
selector = selector.fit(X, y)

print(f"Optimal number of features: {selector.n_features_}")
print(f"Feature ranking: {selector.ranking_}")
```

Slide 10: Cross-Validation for Model Comparison

Cross-validation is an effective way to compare different models or algorithms. By using the same cross-validation splits for each model, we can get a fair comparison of their performances.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load sample data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Define models
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'SVM': SVC()
}

# Compare models using cross-validation
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f"{name} - Mean accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.2f})")
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Predicting Diabetes

Let's use cross-validation to evaluate a model for predicting diabetes based on various health metrics. This example demonstrates how cross-validation can be applied to real-world medical data.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Load the diabetes dataset
diabetes = load_diabetes()
X, y = diabetes.data, diabetes.target

# Create a random forest regressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(rf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')

# Convert MSE to RMSE
rmse_scores = np.sqrt(-scores)

print(f"RMSE scores: {rmse_scores}")
print(f"Mean RMSE: {rmse_scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {rmse_scores.std() * 2:.2f})")
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Image Classification

In this example, we'll use cross-validation to evaluate a convolutional neural network for image classification. We'll use a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset to keep the computation manageable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
import numpy as np

# Load a subset of CIFAR-10 data
(x_train, y_train), _ = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
x_train, y_train = x_train[:1000], y_train[:1000]
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Define the model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
cv_scores = []

for train_index, val_index in kf.split(x_train):
    x_train_fold, x_val_fold = x_train[train_index], x_train[val_index]
    y_train_fold, y_val_fold = y_train[train_index], y_train[val_index]
    
    model = create_model()
    model.fit(x_train_fold, y_train_fold, epochs=5, verbose=0)
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_val_fold, y_val_fold, verbose=0)
    cv_scores.append(accuracy)

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}")
print(f"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(cv_scores):.2f} (+/- {np.std(cv_scores) * 2:.2f})")
```

Slide 13: Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

When using cross-validation, it's important to keep in mind several best practices and common pitfalls:

1. Ensure that your cross-validation strategy matches your problem. For time series data, use time series cross-validation.
2. Be aware of data leakage. Preprocessing should be done within each fold, not on the entire dataset beforehand.
3. For small datasets, consider using leave-one-out cross-validation or repeated k-fold cross-validation.
4. Balance between computational cost and estimation accuracy when choosing the number of folds.
5. For imbalanced datasets, use stratified k-fold cross-validation to maintain class proportions across folds.
6. Remember that cross-validation provides an estimate of model performance, not a guarantee.

```python
# Example of correct preprocessing within cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Correct way: Include preprocessing in the pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC())
scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Correct cross-validation scores: {scores.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.2f})")

# Incorrect way: Preprocessing outside of cross-validation
X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)
scores_incorrect = cross_val_score(SVC(), X_scaled, y, cv=5)

print(f"Incorrect cross-validation scores: {scores_incorrect.mean():.2f} (+/- {scores_incorrect.std() * 2:.2f})")
```

Slide 14: Cross-Validation in Ensemble Methods

Cross-validation plays a crucial role in ensemble methods, particularly in techniques like stacking. In stacking, we use predictions from multiple models as input features for a meta-model. Cross-validation ensures that these predictions are made on data that the base models haven't seen during training.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=10, random_state=42)

# Define base models
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Generate cross-validated predictions
rf_preds = cross_val_predict(rf, X, y, cv=5, method='predict_proba')
gb_preds = cross_val_predict(gb, X, y, cv=5, method='predict_proba')

# Combine predictions for meta-features
meta_features = np.column_stack((rf_preds, gb_preds))

# Train meta-model
meta_model = LogisticRegression()
meta_model.fit(meta_features, y)

print("Stacking ensemble trained using cross-validated predictions")
```
