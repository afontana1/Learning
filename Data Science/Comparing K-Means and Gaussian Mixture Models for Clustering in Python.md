## Comparing K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models for Clustering in Python

Slide 1: Introduction to Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features. Two popular clustering algorithms are K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). In this slideshow, we'll explore the differences between these two algorithms and implement them in Python.

Slide 2: K-Means Clustering

K-Means is a simple and popular clustering algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on their distances from cluster centroids. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Create a KMeans instance with 2 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)

# Fit the model and get cluster labels
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Print cluster labels
print(labels)
```

Slide 3: K-Means Clustering Visualization

To visualize the K-Means clustering results, we can use a scatter plot and color the data points based on their assigned cluster labels.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=100, c='red')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It assigns data points to clusters based on their likelihood of belonging to each Gaussian component.

```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Create a GMM instance with 2 components
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, random_state=0)

# Fit the model and get cluster labels
labels = gmm.fit_predict(X)

# Print cluster labels
print(labels)
```

Slide 5: GMM Visualization

Similar to K-Means, we can visualize the GMM clustering results using a scatter plot and color the data points based on their assigned cluster labels.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the data points
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.title('Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Choosing the Number of Clusters

Both K-Means and GMM require specifying the number of clusters (K or n\_components) beforehand. To choose an appropriate number, we can use techniques like the Elbow method for K-Means or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for GMM.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
X = ...

# Elbow method for K-Means
inertias = []
for k in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=0)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    inertias.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Plot the elbow curve
plt.plot(range(1, 11), inertias)
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('Inertia')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Advantages of K-Means

K-Means is a simple and efficient algorithm that works well with compact and well-separated clusters. It is easy to understand and implement, and it has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of data points.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, n_features=2, random_state=0)

# Create a KMeans instance and fit the model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=100, c='red')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering on Well-Separated Blobs')
plt.show()
```

Slide 8: Disadvantages of K-Means

K-Means has limitations when dealing with non-convex or overlapping clusters. It is sensitive to outliers and the initial centroid positions, and it cannot handle clusters of different sizes or densities well.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data with non-convex clusters
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, cluster_std=[1.0, 2.5, 0.5], random_state=0)

# Create a KMeans instance and fit the model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=100, c='red')
plt.title('K-Means Clustering on Non-Convex Clusters')
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Advantages of GMM

GMM is a more flexible and robust algorithm that can handle non-convex and overlapping clusters. It can model clusters with different sizes, densities, and covariance structures, making it suitable for complex data distributions.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data with overlapping clusters
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, cluster_std=1.5, random_state=0)

# Create a GMM instance and fit the model
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=3, random_state=0)
labels = gmm.fit_predict(X)

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.title('Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering on Overlapping Clusters')
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Disadvantages of GMM

GMM is computationally more expensive than K-Means, especially for large datasets and high-dimensional data. It can be sensitive to initialization and may converge to local optima, leading to suboptimal solutions.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import time

# Generate a large sample dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=100000, centers=5, n_features=10, random_state=0)

# Time the fitting process for GMM
start_time = time.time()
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5, random_state=0)
gmm.fit(X)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Time taken to fit GMM on large dataset: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 11: Choosing Between K-Means and GMM

When choosing between K-Means and GMM, consider the characteristics of your data and the desired clustering behavior. K-Means is a good choice for simple and well-separated clusters, while GMM is more suitable for complex and overlapping clusters or when you need to model different cluster shapes and densities.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs, make_moons
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

# Generate well-separated blobs
X_blobs, y_blobs = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, n_features=2, random_state=0)

# Generate overlapping moons
X_moons, y_moons = make_moons(n_samples=1000, noise=0.05, random_state=0)

# Cluster the blobs using K-Means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
labels_blobs = kmeans.fit_predict(X_blobs)

# Cluster the moons using GMM
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, random_state=0)
labels_moons = gmm.fit_predict(X_moons)

# Plot the results
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

ax1.scatter(X_blobs[:, 0], X_blobs[:, 1], c=labels_blobs)
ax1.set_title('K-Means Clustering on Well-Separated Blobs')

ax2.scatter(X_moons[:, 0], X_moons[:, 1], c=labels_moons)
ax2.set_title('Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering on Overlapping Moons')

plt.show()
```

Slide 12: Conclusion

Both algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the specific problem and data characteristics. Understanding these algorithms and their implementation is essential for effective data analysis and clustering tasks.
