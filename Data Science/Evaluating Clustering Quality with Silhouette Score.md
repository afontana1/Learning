## Evaluating Clustering Quality with Silhouette Score

Slide 1: Understanding Clustering and Silhouette Score

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. The Silhouette Score is a metric that evaluates the quality of these clusters. It measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to other clusters. This score ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to 1 indicate well-defined clusters, values around 0 suggest overlapping clusters, and negative values might indicate incorrect cluster assignments.

```python
import random

def generate_cluster_data(n_points, n_clusters):
    data = []
    for _ in range(n_clusters):
        center = (random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10))
        cluster = [(center[0] + random.gauss(0, 1), center[1] + random.gauss(0, 1)) 
                   for _ in range(n_points // n_clusters)]
        data.extend(cluster)
    return data

# Generate sample clustered data
sample_data = generate_cluster_data(300, 3)

# Print first 5 data points
print("Sample data points:")
for point in sample_data[:5]:
    print(f"({point[0]:.2f}, {point[1]:.2f})")
```

Slide 2: Implementing K-means Clustering from Scratch

K-means is a popular clustering algorithm. It aims to partition n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). We'll implement this algorithm from scratch using only built-in Python functions.

```python
import random
import math

def euclidean_distance(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt(sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(point1, point2)))

def kmeans(data, k, max_iterations=100):
    # Initialize centroids randomly
    centroids = random.sample(data, k)
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        # Assign points to nearest centroid
        clusters = [[] for _ in range(k)]
        for point in data:
            nearest_centroid = min(range(k), key=lambda i: euclidean_distance(point, centroids[i]))
            clusters[nearest_centroid].append(point)
        
        # Update centroids
        new_centroids = []
        for cluster in clusters:
            if cluster:
                new_centroid = tuple(sum(coord) / len(cluster) for coord in zip(*cluster))
                new_centroids.append(new_centroid)
            else:
                new_centroids.append(random.choice(data))  # Reinitialize empty clusters
        
        # Check for convergence
        if new_centroids == centroids:
            break
        
        centroids = new_centroids
    
    return clusters, centroids

# Use the sample data from the previous slide
clusters, centroids = kmeans(sample_data, 3)

print("Number of points in each cluster:")
for i, cluster in enumerate(clusters):
    print(f"Cluster {i+1}: {len(cluster)} points")

print("\nFinal centroids:")
for i, centroid in enumerate(centroids):
    print(f"Centroid {i+1}: ({centroid[0]:.2f}, {centroid[1]:.2f})")
```

Slide 3: Implementing Silhouette Score from Scratch

The Silhouette Score quantifies the quality of clustering. For each data point, it compares the average distance to points in its own cluster (a) with the average distance to points in the nearest neighboring cluster (b). The Silhouette Score is then calculated as (b - a) / max(a, b).

```python
def silhouette_score(data, clusters):
    def avg_distance(point, cluster):
        return sum(euclidean_distance(point, other) for other in cluster) / len(cluster)

    silhouette_values = []

    for i, cluster in enumerate(clusters):
        for point in cluster:
            a = avg_distance(point, cluster)
            
            b = float('inf')
            for j, other_cluster in enumerate(clusters):
                if i != j:
                    avg_dist = avg_distance(point, other_cluster)
                    b = min(b, avg_dist)
            
            silhouette = (b - a) / max(a, b) if max(a, b) > 0 else 0
            silhouette_values.append(silhouette)

    return sum(silhouette_values) / len(silhouette_values)

# Calculate Silhouette Score for our clustering
score = silhouette_score(sample_data, clusters)
print(f"Silhouette Score: {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Interpreting the Silhouette Score

The Silhouette Score ranges from -1 to 1. A score closer to 1 indicates that data points are well-matched to their own clusters and poorly-matched to neighboring clusters. A score around 0 suggests overlapping clusters, while negative scores might indicate that data points are assigned to the wrong clusters. In practice, scores above 0.5 are often considered good, while scores below 0.3 might suggest poor clustering quality.

```python
def interpret_silhouette_score(score):
    if score > 0.7:
        return "Excellent clustering"
    elif score > 0.5:
        return "Good clustering"
    elif score > 0.3:
        return "Fair clustering, consider adjusting parameters"
    else:
        return "Poor clustering, reevaluate your approach"

# Interpret our Silhouette Score
interpretation = interpret_silhouette_score(score)
print(f"Interpretation: {interpretation}")

# Generate scores for different numbers of clusters
for k in range(2, 6):
    clusters, _ = kmeans(sample_data, k)
    score = silhouette_score(sample_data, clusters)
    print(f"K = {k}, Silhouette Score: {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Calibrating Silhouette Scores

To make Silhouette Scores more intuitive, especially for non-technical stakeholders, we can calibrate them to a \[0, 1\] scale. This transformation maintains the relative ordering of scores while making them easier to interpret as percentages or probabilities.

```python
def calibrate_silhouette_score(score):
    # Transform score from [-1, 1] to [0, 1]
    return (score + 1) / 2

# Original and calibrated scores for different clustering scenarios
scenarios = [
    ("Well-separated clusters", 0.8),
    ("Overlapping clusters", 0.3),
    ("Poorly defined clusters", -0.2)
]

print("Scenario | Original Score | Calibrated Score")
print("---------+----------------+-----------------")
for scenario, orig_score in scenarios:
    calibrated = calibrate_silhouette_score(orig_score)
    print(f"{scenario:<9} | {orig_score:14.2f} | {calibrated:15.2f}")

# Calibrate our actual score
calibrated_score = calibrate_silhouette_score(score)
print(f"\nOur clustering - Original: {score:.4f}, Calibrated: {calibrated_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 6: Using Silhouette Score in Production

In production environments, Silhouette Score can serve as a confidence metric for clustering results. It can be used to monitor clustering quality over time, trigger alerts for unexpected changes, or dynamically adjust clustering parameters. Here's a simple example of how to implement this in a production-like setting:

```python
import time

def simulate_production_data(n_points, n_clusters, noise_level):
    base_data = generate_cluster_data(n_points, n_clusters)
    noisy_data = [(x + random.gauss(0, noise_level), y + random.gauss(0, noise_level)) 
                  for x, y in base_data]
    return noisy_data

def monitor_clustering_quality(data, k, threshold=0.5):
    clusters, _ = kmeans(data, k)
    score = silhouette_score(data, clusters)
    calibrated_score = calibrate_silhouette_score(score)
    
    if calibrated_score < threshold:
        print(f"Alert: Low clustering quality detected! Score: {calibrated_score:.4f}")
    else:
        print(f"Clustering quality acceptable. Score: {calibrated_score:.4f}")
    
    return calibrated_score

# Simulate a production environment
for i in range(5):
    print(f"\nIteration {i+1}")
    production_data = simulate_production_data(300, 3, noise_level=0.5 * i)
    score = monitor_clustering_quality(production_data, k=3)
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate time passing between checks
```

Slide 7: Real-life Example: Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is a common application of clustering in business. Let's consider an e-commerce platform that wants to segment its customers based on their purchasing behavior. We'll use two features: average order value and purchase frequency.

```python
def generate_customer_data(n_customers):
    data = []
    # Loyal high-value customers
    data.extend([(random.gauss(200, 30), random.gauss(10, 2)) for _ in range(n_customers // 3)])
    # Regular mid-value customers
    data.extend([(random.gauss(100, 20), random.gauss(5, 1)) for _ in range(n_customers // 3)])
    # Occasional low-value customers
    data.extend([(random.gauss(50, 10), random.gauss(2, 0.5)) for _ in range(n_customers // 3)])
    return data

customer_data = generate_customer_data(300)

# Perform clustering
clusters, centroids = kmeans(customer_data, 3)

# Calculate and interpret Silhouette Score
score = silhouette_score(customer_data, clusters)
calibrated_score = calibrate_silhouette_score(score)

print(f"Customer Segmentation Silhouette Score: {score:.4f}")
print(f"Calibrated Score: {calibrated_score:.4f}")
print(f"Interpretation: {interpret_silhouette_score(score)}")

# Print cluster centroids
for i, centroid in enumerate(centroids):
    print(f"Segment {i+1} centroid: Avg Order Value: ${centroid[0]:.2f}, "
          f"Purchase Frequency: {centroid[1]:.2f} times/month")
```

Slide 8: Real-life Example: Document Clustering

Document clustering is useful in various applications, such as organizing large collections of texts or improving search results. Let's simulate a simple document clustering scenario using word frequency as features.

```python
import string

def preprocess_text(text):
    return ''.join(c.lower() for c in text if c not in string.punctuation)

def text_to_vector(text, vocabulary):
    words = preprocess_text(text).split()
    return [words.count(word) for word in vocabulary]

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence",
    "Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers",
    "Natural language processing deals with text and speech",
    "Computer vision focuses on image and video analysis",
    "Reinforcement learning involves agents and environments",
    "Data science combines statistics and programming",
    "Big data requires distributed computing systems",
    "Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure"
]

# Create vocabulary and document vectors
vocabulary = list(set(word for doc in documents for word in preprocess_text(doc).split()))
doc_vectors = [text_to_vector(doc, vocabulary) for doc in documents]

# Perform clustering
clusters, _ = kmeans(doc_vectors, 3)

# Calculate Silhouette Score
score = silhouette_score(doc_vectors, clusters)
calibrated_score = calibrate_silhouette_score(score)

print(f"Document Clustering Silhouette Score: {score:.4f}")
print(f"Calibrated Score: {calibrated_score:.4f}")
print(f"Interpretation: {interpret_silhouette_score(score)}")

# Print cluster contents
for i, cluster in enumerate(clusters):
    print(f"\nCluster {i+1}:")
    for j in cluster:
        print(f"- {documents[j][:50]}...")
```

Slide 9: Optimizing Number of Clusters

One common use of the Silhouette Score is to determine the optimal number of clusters. By calculating the score for different numbers of clusters, we can find the configuration that produces the best-defined clusters.

```python
def optimize_clusters(data, max_clusters):
    scores = []
    for k in range(2, max_clusters + 1):
        clusters, _ = kmeans(data, k)
        score = silhouette_score(data, clusters)
        scores.append((k, score))
    
    return max(scores, key=lambda x: x[1])

# Optimize clusters for customer data
customer_data = generate_customer_data(300)
optimal_k, best_score = optimize_clusters(customer_data, 10)

print(f"Optimal number of clusters: {optimal_k}")
print(f"Best Silhouette Score: {best_score:.4f}")

# Plot Silhouette Scores
print("\nSilhouette Scores for different numbers of clusters:")
for k in range(2, 11):
    clusters, _ = kmeans(customer_data, k)
    score = silhouette_score(customer_data, clusters)
    print(f"K = {k}: {'*' * int(score * 50)} {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 10: Handling High-Dimensional Data

When dealing with high-dimensional data, calculating distances becomes computationally expensive and less meaningful due to the "curse of dimensionality". In such cases, dimensionality reduction techniques can be applied before clustering. Here's a simple example using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implemented from scratch:

```python
def pca(data, n_components):
    # Center the data
    mean = [sum(col) / len(col) for col in zip(*data)]
    centered = [[x - m for x, m in zip(point, mean)] for point in data]
    
    # Compute covariance matrix
    cov_matrix = [[sum(a * b for a, b in zip(col1, col2)) / (len(data) - 1)
                   for col2 in zip(*centered)] for col1 in zip(*centered)]
    
    # Compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues
    def power_iteration(matrix, num_iterations=100):
        b_k = [random.random() for _ in range(len(matrix))]
        for _ in range(num_iterations):
            b_k1 = [sum(matrix[i][j] * b_k[j] for j in range(len(matrix))) for i in range(len(matrix))]
            b_k1_norm = math.sqrt(sum(x**2 for x in b_k1))
            b_k = [x / b_k1_norm for x in b_k1]
        return b_k
    
    eigenvectors = [power_iteration(cov_matrix) for _ in range(n_components)]
    
    # Project data
    return [[sum(a * b for a, b in zip(point, evec)) for evec in eigenvectors] for point in centered]

# Generate high-dimensional data
high_dim_data = [[random.gauss(0, 1) for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(100)]

# Reduce dimensionality
reduced_data = pca(high_dim_data, 2)

# Cluster reduced data
clusters, _ = kmeans(reduced_data, 3)
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, clusters)

print(f"Silhouette Score after dimensionality reduction: {score:.4f}")
print(f"Interpretation: {interpret_silhouette_score(score)}")
```

Slide 11: Handling Outliers

Outliers can significantly affect clustering results and Silhouette Scores. One approach to mitigate this is to use a robust clustering algorithm or to preprocess the data to remove or dampen the effect of outliers. Here's an example of how to implement a simple outlier detection and removal technique using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:

```python
def remove_outliers(data, k=1.5):
    def iqr_boundaries(values):
        sorted_values = sorted(values)
        q1, q3 = sorted_values[len(sorted_values)//4], sorted_values[3*len(sorted_values)//4]
        iqr = q3 - q1
        lower_bound = q1 - k * iqr
        upper_bound = q3 + k * iqr
        return lower_bound, upper_bound

    dimensions = list(zip(*data))
    bounds = [iqr_boundaries(dim) for dim in dimensions]
    
    cleaned_data = []
    for point in data:
        if all(bound[0] <= value <= bound[1] for value, bound in zip(point, bounds)):
            cleaned_data.append(point)
    
    return cleaned_data

# Generate data with outliers
data_with_outliers = generate_cluster_data(300, 3)
data_with_outliers.extend([(100, 100), (-100, -100)])  # Add outliers

# Remove outliers
cleaned_data = remove_outliers(data_with_outliers)

print(f"Original data points: {len(data_with_outliers)}")
print(f"Cleaned data points: {len(cleaned_data)}")

# Compare clustering results
original_clusters, _ = kmeans(data_with_outliers, 3)
original_score = silhouette_score(data_with_outliers, original_clusters)

cleaned_clusters, _ = kmeans(cleaned_data, 3)
cleaned_score = silhouette_score(cleaned_data, cleaned_clusters)

print(f"Original Silhouette Score: {original_score:.4f}")
print(f"Cleaned Silhouette Score: {cleaned_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 12: Comparing Silhouette Score with Other Metrics

While Silhouette Score is useful, it's often beneficial to compare it with other clustering evaluation metrics. Here we'll implement and compare Silhouette Score with the Davies-Bouldin Index, another internal clustering evaluation metric that doesn't require ground truth labels.

```python
def davies_bouldin_index(data, clusters):
    def cluster_diameter(cluster):
        return max(euclidean_distance(p1, p2) for p1 in cluster for p2 in cluster)
    
    def cluster_centroid(cluster):
        return tuple(sum(coord) / len(cluster) for coord in zip(*cluster))
    
    n = len(clusters)
    centroids = [cluster_centroid(cluster) for cluster in clusters]
    diameters = [cluster_diameter(cluster) for cluster in clusters]
    
    db_index = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_ratio = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                ratio = (diameters[i] + diameters[j]) / euclidean_distance(centroids[i], centroids[j])
                max_ratio = max(max_ratio, ratio)
        db_index += max_ratio
    
    return db_index / n

# Generate clustered data
data = generate_cluster_data(300, 3)

# Perform clustering
clusters, _ = kmeans(data, 3)

# Calculate metrics
silhouette = silhouette_score(data, clusters)
db_index = davies_bouldin_index(data, clusters)

print(f"Silhouette Score: {silhouette:.4f}")
print(f"Davies-Bouldin Index: {db_index:.4f}")
print("Note: For Silhouette Score, higher is better. For Davies-Bouldin Index, lower is better.")
```

Slide 13: Visualizing Clustering Results

Visualization is crucial for understanding clustering results. While we can't use external libraries, we can create a simple ASCII plot to visualize 2D clustering results along with the Silhouette Score.

```python
def ascii_plot(data, clusters, width=60, height=20):
    min_x = min(p[0] for p in data)
    max_x = max(p[0] for p in data)
    min_y = min(p[1] for p in data)
    max_y = max(p[1] for p in data)
    
    def scale(value, min_val, max_val, size):
        return int((value - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) * (size - 1))
    
    plot = [[' ' for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
    
    for cluster_idx, cluster in enumerate(clusters):
        for point in cluster:
            x = scale(point[0], min_x, max_x, width)
            y = height - 1 - scale(point[1], min_y, max_y, height)
            plot[y][x] = str(cluster_idx)
    
    return '\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in plot)

# Generate and cluster 2D data
data = generate_cluster_data(300, 3)
clusters, _ = kmeans(data, 3)

# Calculate Silhouette Score
score = silhouette_score(data, clusters)

print(f"Clustering Visualization (Silhouette Score: {score:.4f})")
print(ascii_plot(data, clusters))
```

Slide 14: Conclusion and Best Practices

The Silhouette Score is a valuable tool for evaluating clustering quality, especially in production environments where ground truth labels are unavailable. Here are some best practices:

1.  Use Silhouette Score alongside other metrics for a comprehensive evaluation.
2.  Calibrate scores to a \[0, 1\] range for easier interpretation by non-technical stakeholders.
3.  Monitor Silhouette Scores over time to detect changes in data distribution or clustering quality.
4.  Use Silhouette Scores to optimize the number of clusters.
5.  Be aware of the limitations, such as sensitivity to density and the "curse of dimensionality".

By following these practices, you can enhance the confidence in your clustering results and make more informed decisions based on your data groupings.
