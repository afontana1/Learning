## Introduction to Precision-Recall Curve in Python
Slide 1: 

Introduction to Precision-Recall Curve

The Precision-Recall Curve is a powerful evaluation metric used in machine learning, particularly in classification tasks. It provides a way to assess the performance of a binary classifier by visualizing the trade-off between precision and recall at different classification thresholds.

Code:

```python
# No code for the introduction slide
```

Slide 2: 

Understanding Precision and Recall

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions made by the model. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

# Assuming y_true and y_pred are the actual and predicted labels, respectively
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

Slide 3: 

Precision-Recall Curve: Concept

The Precision-Recall Curve plots precision on the y-axis and recall on the x-axis for different classification thresholds. By adjusting the threshold, the model can trade precision for recall, or vice versa, depending on the specific requirements of the task.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

plt.plot(recall, precision)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.show()
```

Slide 4: 

Interpreting the Precision-Recall Curve

A perfect classifier will have a Precision-Recall Curve that hugs the top-right corner, indicating high precision and recall values. The closer the curve is to the top-right corner, the better the performance of the classifier.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

# Plot the Precision-Recall Curve
plt.plot(recall, precision, label='Classifier')

# Plot the random classifier baseline (assume equal class distribution)
random_baseline = np.linspace(0, 1, len(precision))
plt.plot(random_baseline, random_baseline, linestyle='--', label='Random Baseline')

plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: 

Calculating Precision-Recall Curve with scikit-learn

The scikit-learn library in Python provides a convenient function to calculate the Precision-Recall Curve for a given set of true labels and predicted scores.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

# Plot the Precision-Recall Curve
plt.plot(recall, precision)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: 

Adjusting Classification Thresholds

The Precision-Recall Curve allows you to choose an appropriate classification threshold based on the desired trade-off between precision and recall for your specific problem.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

# Select a desired threshold value
desired_threshold = 0.5
precision_at_threshold = precision[thresholds >= desired_threshold][-1]
recall_at_threshold = recall[thresholds >= desired_threshold][-1]

print(f"At threshold {desired_threshold}, precision is {precision_at_threshold:.2f} and recall is {recall_at_threshold:.2f}")
```

Slide 7: 

Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)

The Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) is a single scalar value that summarizes the Precision-Recall Curve. It provides an overall performance metric for the classifier, with higher values indicating better performance.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, average_precision_score

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)
auprc = average_precision_score(y_true, y_score)

print(f"Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC): {auprc:.2f}")
```

Slide 8: 

Comparing Classifiers with Precision-Recall Curve

The Precision-Recall Curve can be used to compare the performance of different classifiers on the same dataset. The classifier with the curve closer to the top-right corner is considered better.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true, y_score_clf1, and y_score_clf2 are the actual labels, and predicted scores for two classifiers, respectively
precision_clf1, recall_clf1, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score_clf1)
precision_clf2, recall_clf2, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score_clf2)

plt.plot(recall_clf1, precision_clf1, label='Classifier 1')
plt.plot(recall_clf2, precision_clf2, label='Classifier 2')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve Comparison')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: 

Precision-Recall Curve for Multi-Class Classification

The Precision-Recall Curve can be extended to multi-class classification problems by calculating the curve for each class individually and then averaging the results or using a micro-averaging or macro-averaging approach.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores, respectively
precision = dict()
recall = dict()
for i in range(n_classes):
    precision[i], recall[i], _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true == i, y_score[:, i])

# Plot the Precision-Recall Curve for each class
for i in range(n_classes):
    plt.plot(recall[i], precision[i], label=f'Class {i}')

plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve for Multi-Class Classification')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: 

Precision-Recall Curve for Imbalanced Datasets

The Precision-Recall Curve is particularly useful for evaluating classifiers on imbalanced datasets, where the class distributions are skewed. In such cases, the Precision-Recall Curve provides a more informative perspective than the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores for an imbalanced dataset, respectively
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

plt.plot(recall, precision)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve for Imbalanced Dataset')
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: 

Adjusting for Class Imbalance

When dealing with imbalanced datasets, it is often necessary to adjust the classification threshold to account for the class imbalance. The Precision-Recall Curve can help in selecting an appropriate threshold that balances precision and recall for the minority class.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted scores for an imbalanced dataset, respectively
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

# Choose a desired recall value for the minority class
desired_recall = 0.8
threshold_indices = recall >= desired_recall
chosen_threshold = thresholds[threshold_indices][0]
chosen_precision = precision[threshold_indices][0]

print(f"At threshold {chosen_threshold:.2f}, recall is {desired_recall:.2f} and precision is {chosen_precision:.2f}")
```

Slide 12: 

Precision-Recall Curve for Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is a common use case for the Precision-Recall Curve. In this scenario, the positive class represents anomalies, and the negative class represents normal instances. The Precision-Recall Curve helps evaluate the trade-off between detecting true anomalies and minimizing false positives.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted anomaly scores, respectively
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

plt.plot(recall, precision)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve for Anomaly Detection')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: 

Precision-Recall Curve for Information Retrieval

In information retrieval tasks, such as document classification or web search, the Precision-Recall Curve is commonly used to evaluate the performance of retrieval systems. High precision means retrieving mostly relevant documents, while high recall means retrieving most of the relevant documents.

Code:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming y_true and y_score are the actual labels and predicted relevance scores, respectively
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)

plt.plot(recall, precision)
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve for Information Retrieval')
plt.show()
```
