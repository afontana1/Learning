## Handling Dropout Regularization in Neural Networks
Slide 1: Introduction to Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly deactivating a proportion of neurons during training. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of neurons.

```python
import numpy as np

class Dropout:
    def __init__(self, p=0.5):
        self.p = p
        self.mask = None
    
    def forward(self, X):
        # Generate dropout mask during training
        self.mask = np.random.binomial(1, 1-self.p, X.shape) / (1-self.p)
        # Apply mask to input
        return X * self.mask
    
    def backward(self, dout):
        # Backward pass applies same mask
        return dout * self.mask

# Example usage
X = np.random.randn(4, 5)  # Sample input
dropout = Dropout(p=0.3)
output = dropout.forward(X)
```

Slide 2: Mathematical Foundation of Dropout

The dropout operation can be expressed mathematically as a multiplication of the input tensor with a binary mask sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. During inference, the expected value is preserved through scaling.

```python
# Mathematical representation of dropout in code block
"""
Forward Pass:
$$mask_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p)$$
$$y_{ij} = \frac{mask_{ij}}{1-p} \cdot x_{ij}$$

Backward Pass:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_{ij}} = \frac{mask_{ij}}{1-p} \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial y_{ij}}$$
"""
```

Slide 3: Implementing a Neural Network with Dropout

A complete implementation of a neural network incorporating dropout layers between fully connected layers. This architecture demonstrates how dropout is integrated into the broader network structure.

```python
import numpy as np

class NeuralNetworkWithDropout:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, dropout_rate=0.5):
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size) * 0.01
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size) * 0.01
        self.dropout = Dropout(dropout_rate)
        
    def forward(self, X, training=True):
        self.h1 = np.maximum(0, X.dot(self.W1))  # ReLU activation
        if training:
            self.h1 = self.dropout.forward(self.h1)
        self.output = self.h1.dot(self.W2)  # Output layer
        return self.output
```

Slide 4: Training Loop with Dropout

The training process must handle dropout differently during training and inference phases. During training, dropout is active, while during testing, it's disabled to ensure deterministic predictions.

```python
def train_network(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=100):
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Forward pass with dropout enabled
        output = model.forward(X_train, training=True)
        
        # Compute loss
        loss = np.mean((output - y_train) ** 2)
        
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            # Evaluation without dropout
            test_output = model.forward(X_train, training=False)
            test_loss = np.mean((test_output - y_train) ** 2)
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Train Loss: {loss:.4f}, Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}")
```

Slide 5: Implementing Inverted Dropout

Inverted dropout scales the outputs during training instead of inference, which is more computationally efficient and is the standard implementation in modern deep learning frameworks.

```python
class InvertedDropout:
    def __init__(self, p=0.5):
        self.p = p
        self.mask = None
        self.scale = 1 / (1 - p)  # Scale during training
        
    def forward(self, X, training=True):
        if training:
            self.mask = (np.random.rand(*X.shape) > self.p)
            return X * self.mask * self.scale
        return X  # No scaling needed during inference
```

Slide 6: Practical Application: MNIST Classification

A real-world implementation of dropout in a convolutional neural network for MNIST digit classification, demonstrating significant improvement in preventing overfitting.

```python

    def __init__(self, dropout_rate=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 12 * 12, 128)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        return self.fc2(x)
```

        self.decay = decay
        self.current_rate = initial_rate
        self.step_count = 0
        
    def forward(self, x):
        if self.training:
            self.current_rate = self.initial_rate * (self.decay ** self.step_count)
            self.step_count += 1
            mask = torch.bernoulli(torch.ones_like(x) * (1 - self.current_rate))
            return x * mask / (1 - self.current_rate)
        return x
```

Slide 9: Spatial Dropout Implementation

Spatial Dropout, specifically designed for convolutional neural networks, drops entire feature maps instead of individual neurons, maintaining spatial coherence in the regularization process.

        super().__init__()
        self.p = p

    def forward(self, x):
        if not self.training:
            return x
        
        # Generate binary mask for entire feature maps
        mask = torch.bernoulli(torch.ones(x.shape[0], x.shape[1], 1, 1) * (1 - self.p))
        mask = mask.to(x.device) / (1 - self.p)
        
        return x * mask.expand_as(x)
```

        self.model = model
        self.num_samples = num_samples
        
    def forward(self, x):
        self.model.train()  # Enable dropout during inference
        samples = torch.stack([self.model(x) for _ in range(self.num_samples)])
        mean = torch.mean(samples, dim=0)
        variance = torch.var(samples, dim=0)
        return mean, variance

# Example usage

```python
class ConcreteDropout(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weight_regularizer=1e-6, dropout_regularizer=1e-5):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight_regularizer = weight_regularizer
        self.dropout_regularizer = dropout_regularizer
        self.p_logit = nn.Parameter(torch.log(torch.tensor(1 - 0.1) / 0.1))
        
    def forward(self, x, temperature=0.1):
        p = torch.sigmoid(self.p_logit)
        
        # Concrete distribution sampling
        noise = torch.rand_like(x)
        concrete_noise = torch.sigmoid(
            (torch.log(noise) - torch.log(1 - noise) + self.p_logit) / temperature
        )

    def __init__(self, max_rate=0.5, epochs=100):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_rate = max_rate
        self.epochs = epochs
        self.current_epoch = 0
        
    def forward(self, x):
        if self.training:
            # Calculate current dropout rate based on training progress
            current_rate = self.max_rate * min(1.0, self.current_epoch / (0.5 * self.epochs))
            mask = torch.bernoulli(torch.ones_like(x) * (1 - current_rate))
            return x * mask / (1 - current_rate)
