## Comprehensive Sentiment Analysis Techniques
Slide 1: Introduction to Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is a powerful Natural Language Processing technique used to determine the emotional tone behind text data. It helps businesses, researchers, and organizations understand public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends. This slideshow will cover various methods and techniques for performing sentiment analysis, from basic approaches to advanced algorithms.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Download the VADER lexicon
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

# Initialize the VADER sentiment analyzer
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Example text
text = "I absolutely love this product! It's amazing and works perfectly."

# Perform sentiment analysis
sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)

print(f"Sentiment scores: {sentiment_scores}")
print(f"Overall sentiment: {'Positive' if sentiment_scores['compound'] > 0 else 'Negative' if sentiment_scores['compound'] < 0 else 'Neutral'}")
```

Slide 2: Text Preprocessing for Sentiment Analysis

Before applying sentiment analysis techniques, it's crucial to preprocess the text data. This step involves cleaning and normalizing the text to improve the accuracy of the analysis. Common preprocessing steps include tokenization, lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords, and stemming or lemmatization.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize and lowercase
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    
    # Remove punctuation and stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
    
    # Stemming
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
    
    return ' '.join(stemmed_tokens)

# Example usage
text = "The movie was absolutely fantastic! I loved every minute of it."
preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text)
print(f"Original text: {text}")
print(f"Preprocessed text: {preprocessed_text}")
```

Slide 3: Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis

Lexicon-based approaches use pre-defined dictionaries of words associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These methods are simple to implement and don't require training data, making them suitable for quick sentiment analysis tasks.

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

def lexicon_sentiment(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment = blob.sentiment.polarity
    if sentiment > 0:
        return "Positive"
    elif sentiment < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Neutral"

# Example usage
texts = [
    "I absolutely love this product!",
    "This is the worst experience ever.",
    "The weather is nice today."
]

for text in texts:
    sentiment = lexicon_sentiment(text)
    print(f"Text: '{text}'\nSentiment: {sentiment}\n")
```

Slide 4: Machine Learning for Sentiment Analysis

Machine learning approaches to sentiment analysis involve training models on labeled data to classify text into sentiment categories. These methods can capture more complex patterns in text data compared to lexicon-based approaches.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample dataset
texts = [
    "I love this product",
    "This is terrible",
    "Great experience",
    "Awful service",
    "Neutral opinion"
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]  # 1: Positive, 0: Negative, 2: Neutral

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Vectorize the text
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Predict on test data
predictions = clf.predict(X_test_vec)

# Print results
for text, pred in zip(X_test, predictions):
    sentiment = "Positive" if pred == 1 else "Negative" if pred == 0 else "Neutral"
    print(f"Text: '{text}'\nPredicted sentiment: {sentiment}\n")
```

Slide 5: Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis

Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, have shown impressive results in sentiment analysis tasks. These models can capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies in text data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample dataset
texts = [
    "I love this product",
    "This is terrible",
    "Great experience",
    "Awful service",
    "Neutral opinion"
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 2]  # 1: Positive, 0: Negative, 2: Neutral

# Tokenize the text
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token="<OOV>")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10, padding='post', truncating='post')

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 16, input_length=10),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Make predictions
new_texts = ["This is amazing", "I hate this"]
new_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(new_texts)
new_padded = pad_sequences(new_sequences, maxlen=10, padding='post', truncating='post')
predictions = model.predict(new_padded)

for text, pred in zip(new_texts, predictions):
    sentiment = ["Negative", "Positive", "Neutral"][pred.argmax()]
    print(f"Text: '{text}'\nPredicted sentiment: {sentiment}\n")
```

Slide 6: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a more granular approach that aims to identify the sentiment associated with specific aspects or features of a product or service. This technique is particularly useful for businesses looking to gain detailed insights from customer reviews.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def aspect_based_sentiment(text, aspects):
    doc = nlp(text)
    results = {}
    
    for aspect in aspects:
        sentiment = 0
        for token in doc:
            if token.text.lower() == aspect.lower():
                for child in token.children:
                    if child.pos_ == "ADJ":
                        sentiment += child.similarity(nlp("good")) - child.similarity(nlp("bad"))
        
        results[aspect] = "Positive" if sentiment > 0 else "Negative" if sentiment < 0 else "Neutral"
    
    return results

# Example usage
review = "The food was delicious but the service was slow. The ambiance was nice though."
aspects = ["food", "service", "ambiance"]

results = aspect_based_sentiment(review, aspects)
print("Review:", review)
for aspect, sentiment in results.items():
    print(f"Aspect: {aspect}, Sentiment: {sentiment}")
```

Slide 7: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

Multimodal Sentiment Analysis combines text, image, and audio data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. This approach is particularly useful for analyzing social media content, where posts often include multiple types of media.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img, img_to_array

# Assuming we have a pre-trained text sentiment model
text_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('text_sentiment_model.h5')

# Load pre-trained VGG16 model for image features
image_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

def multimodal_sentiment(text, image_path):
    # Analyze text sentiment
    text_sentiment = text_model.predict([text])[0]
    
    # Process image
    img = load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = img_to_array(img)
    img_array = tf.keras.applications.vgg16.preprocess_input(img_array)
    img_features = image_model.predict(tf.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0))
    
    # Combine text and image features (simple average for demonstration)
    combined_sentiment = (text_sentiment + img_features.mean()) / 2
    
    return "Positive" if combined_sentiment > 0.5 else "Negative"

# Example usage
text = "Had a great time at the party!"
image_path = "party_image.jpg"

result = multimodal_sentiment(text, image_path)
print(f"Text: '{text}'\nImage: {image_path}\nOverall sentiment: {result}")
```

Slide 8: Real-time and Streaming Sentiment Analysis

Real-time and streaming sentiment analysis is crucial for applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis. This approach involves processing incoming data in real-time to provide up-to-date sentiment insights.

```python
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob

# Twitter API credentials (replace with your own)
consumer_key = "your_consumer_key"
consumer_secret = "your_consumer_secret"
access_token = "your_access_token"
access_token_secret = "your_access_token_secret"

# Authenticate with Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

class StreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
    def on_status(self, status):
        text = status.text
        sentiment = TextBlob(text).sentiment.polarity
        print(f"Tweet: {text}")
        print(f"Sentiment: {'Positive' if sentiment > 0 else 'Negative' if sentiment < 0 else 'Neutral'}\n")

# Start streaming
stream_listener = StreamListener()
stream = tweepy.Stream(auth=api.auth, listener=stream_listener)
stream.filter(track=["python"])  # Replace with your desired keywords
```

Slide 9: Adversarial Attacks and Robustness in Sentiment Analysis

Adversarial attacks in sentiment analysis involve deliberately crafting input text to manipulate model outputs. Building robust models that can withstand such attacks is crucial for developing reliable sentiment analysis systems.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Assume we have a pre-trained sentiment model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('sentiment_model.h5')

def generate_adversarial_example(text, model, epsilon=0.01):
    tokenizer = Tokenizer()
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts([text])
    sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text])
    padded_sequence = pad_sequences(sequence, maxlen=100)
    
    # Get the model's prediction
    original_prediction = model.predict(padded_sequence)[0]
    
    # Generate adversarial perturbation
    input_grad = model.get_gradients(model.input, model.output)[0]
    gradient = tf.keras.backend.get_value(input_grad)
    perturbation = epsilon * np.sign(gradient)
    
    # Apply perturbation
    adversarial_sequence = padded_sequence + perturbation
    
    # Get new prediction
    adversarial_prediction = model.predict(adversarial_sequence)[0]
    
    return original_prediction, adversarial_prediction

# Example usage
text = "This movie was fantastic!"
original, adversarial = generate_adversarial_example(text, model)

print(f"Original text: {text}")
print(f"Original sentiment: {'Positive' if original > 0.5 else 'Negative'}")
print(f"Adversarial sentiment: {'Positive' if adversarial > 0.5 else 'Negative'}")
```

Slide 10: Transfer Learning for Sentiment Analysis

Transfer learning allows us to leverage pre-trained models for improved performance on sentiment analysis tasks with limited labeled data. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with domain-specific sentiment analysis challenges.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)

# Prepare your data
texts = ["I love this product", "This is terrible", "Great experience", "Awful service"]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1: Positive, 0: Negative

# Tokenize and encode the texts
encodings = tokenizer(texts, truncation=True, padding=True, return_tensors='tf')
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(encodings), labels)).batch(2)

# Fine-tune the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)
loss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(dataset, epochs=3)

# Make predictions
new_texts = ["This is amazing", "I hate this"]
new_encodings = tokenizer(new_texts, truncation=True, padding=True, return_tensors='tf')
predictions = model.predict(dict(new_encodings))

for text, pred in zip(new_texts, predictions.logits):
    sentiment = "Positive" if pred[0] < pred[1] else "Negative"
    print(f"Text: '{text}'\nPredicted sentiment: {sentiment}\n")
```

Slide 11: Multilingual and Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis

Multilingual and cross-lingual sentiment analysis involves building models that can understand and analyze sentiment across different languages and cultures. This is particularly challenging due to the diverse ways sentiment is expressed in various languages.

```python
from transformers import pipeline, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# Load a multilingual sentiment analysis model
model_name = "nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Example texts in different languages
texts = [
    "I love this product!",  # English
    "J'adore ce produit !",  # French
    "Ich liebe dieses Produkt!",  # German
    "Me encanta este producto!",  # Spanish
    "Amo questo prodotto!"  # Italian
]

for text in texts:
    result = sentiment_pipeline(text)[0]
    print(f"Text: '{text}'")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```

Slide 12: Domain-Specific Sentiment Analysis

Domain-specific sentiment analysis recognizes that sentiment expressions can vary significantly across different fields such as healthcare, politics, or technology. This approach involves tailoring sentiment analysis models to understand the unique vocabulary and context of a particular domain.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load domain-specific dataset (example: movie reviews)
data = pd.read_csv('movie_reviews.csv')
X = data['review']
y = data['sentiment']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer with domain-specific stop words
domain_stop_words = ['movie', 'film', 'cinema', 'actor', 'actress', 'director']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english' + domain_stop_words)

# Transform the text data
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a Support Vector Machine classifier
clf = SVC(kernel='linear')
clf.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Test the model
accuracy = clf.score(X_test_vec, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Predict sentiment for a new review
new_review = "The special effects were incredible, but the plot was weak."
new_review_vec = vectorizer.transform([new_review])
prediction = clf.predict(new_review_vec)[0]
print(f"Review: '{new_review}'\nPredicted sentiment: {prediction}")
```

Slide 13: Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis

Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis goes beyond overall sentiment by identifying sentiments associated with specific aspects or features of a product or service. This granular approach provides more detailed insights for businesses and researchers.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def aspect_sentiment(text, aspects):
    doc = nlp(text)
    results = {}
    
    for aspect in aspects:
        aspect_token = None
        for token in doc:
            if token.text.lower() == aspect.lower():
                aspect_token = token
                break
        
        if aspect_token:
            sentiment = 0
            for child in aspect_token.children:
                if child.dep_ in ["amod", "advmod"]:
                    sentiment += child.similarity(nlp("good")) - child.similarity(nlp("bad"))
            
            results[aspect] = "Positive" if sentiment > 0 else "Negative" if sentiment < 0 else "Neutral"
        else:
            results[aspect] = "Not mentioned"
    
    return results

# Example usage
review = "The pizza was delicious but the service was slow. The atmosphere was cozy though."
aspects = ["pizza", "service", "atmosphere", "price"]

results = aspect_sentiment(review, aspects)
print("Review:", review)
for aspect, sentiment in results.items():
    print(f"Aspect: {aspect}, Sentiment: {sentiment}")
```

Slide 14: Emotion Detection in Sentiment Analysis

Emotion detection extends sentiment analysis by identifying specific emotions like joy, anger, sadness, or fear in text. This provides a more nuanced understanding of the emotional content beyond simple positive or negative sentiment.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained emotion detection model
emotion_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base", top_k=None)

def detect_emotions(text):
    results = emotion_classifier(text)[0]
    emotions = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
    return emotions

# Example usage
texts = [
    "I'm so excited about the upcoming concert!",
    "The news of the accident left me feeling devastated.",
    "I can't believe they cancelled the show. I'm furious!"
]

for text in texts:
    emotions = detect_emotions(text)
    print(f"Text: '{text}'")
    print("Detected emotions:")
    for emotion in emotions[:3]:  # Print top 3 emotions
        print(f"  {emotion['label']}: {emotion['score']:.4f}")
    print()
```
