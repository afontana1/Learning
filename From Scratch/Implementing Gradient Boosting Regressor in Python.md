## Implementing Gradient Boosting Regressor in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Gradient Boosting Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictor. This technique combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3):
        self.n_estimators = n_estimators
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.trees = []
```

Slide 2: Preparing the Data

Before implementing the Gradient Boosting Regressor, we need to prepare our data. This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, as well as normalizing the features if necessary.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load your dataset (X, y)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

Slide 3: Initializing the Model

The first step in our Gradient Boosting Regressor is to initialize the model with an initial prediction. This is typically the mean of the target variable in the training set.

```python
class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    # ... (previous code)

    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.initial_prediction = np.mean(y)
        self.trees = []

        # Initialize residuals
        residuals = y - self.initial_prediction
        
        for _ in range(self.n_estimators):
            tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=self.max_depth)
            tree.fit(X, residuals)
            self.trees.append(tree)
            
            # Update residuals
            predictions = tree.predict(X)
            residuals -= self.learning_rate * predictions
```

Slide 4: Building Weak Learners

In each iteration, we train a new decision tree on the residuals of the previous predictions. This allows the model to focus on the errors made by the ensemble so far.

```python
def _build_tree(self, X, residuals):
    tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=self.max_depth)
    tree.fit(X, residuals)
    return tree

def fit(self, X, y):
    # ... (previous code)

    for _ in range(self.n_estimators):
        tree = self._build_tree(X, residuals)
        self.trees.append(tree)
        
        # Update residuals
        predictions = tree.predict(X)
        residuals -= self.learning_rate * predictions
```

Slide 5: Making Predictions

To make predictions, we sum up the initial prediction and the weighted predictions of all the trees in our ensemble.

```python
class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    # ... (previous code)

    def predict(self, X):
        predictions = np.full(X.shape[0], self.initial_prediction)
        for tree in self.trees:
            predictions += self.learning_rate * tree.predict(X)
        return predictions
```

Slide 6: Gradient Boosting Algorithm

The core idea of Gradient Boosting is to fit new models to the residuals of the previous models. This process continues for a specified number of iterations, gradually improving the overall prediction.

```python
def fit(self, X, y):
    self.initial_prediction = np.mean(y)
    self.trees = []
    
    current_predictions = np.full(X.shape[0], self.initial_prediction)
    
    for _ in range(self.n_estimators):
        residuals = y - current_predictions
        tree = self._build_tree(X, residuals)
        self.trees.append(tree)
        
        # Update current predictions
        current_predictions += self.learning_rate * tree.predict(X)
```

Slide 7: Handling Overfitting

To prevent overfitting, we use techniques like limiting the maximum depth of trees and applying a learning rate. The learning rate controls how much each tree contributes to the final prediction.

```python
class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3):
        self.n_estimators = n_estimators
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.max_depth = max_depth

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

Slide 8: Model Evaluation

To evaluate our Gradient Boosting Regressor, we can use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). We'll implement a method to calculate these metrics.

```python
def mse(self, X, y):
    predictions = self.predict(X)
    return mean_squared_error(y, predictions)

def rmse(self, X, y):
    return np.sqrt(self.mse(X, y))

# Usage
gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)
train_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_train, y_train)
test_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Train RMSE: {train_rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {test_rmse:.4f}")
```

Slide 9: Feature Importance

One advantage of tree-based models is the ability to calculate feature importance. We'll implement a method to compute and visualize feature importance.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    # ... (previous code)

    def feature_importance(self, feature_names):
        importances = np.zeros(len(feature_names))
        for tree in self.trees:
            importances += tree.feature_importances_
        importances /= len(self.trees)
        
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
        plt.bar(feature_names, importances)
        plt.title("Feature Importance")
        plt.xlabel("Features")
        plt.ylabel("Importance")
        plt.xticks(rotation=45)
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Usage
feature_names = ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4"]
gbr.feature_importance(feature_names)
```

Slide 10: Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize our Gradient Boosting Regressor, we can use techniques like cross-validation and grid search to find the best hyperparameters.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
    'max_depth': [3, 4, 5]
}

gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor()
grid_search = GridSearchCV(gbr, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

print("Best parameters:", best_params)
print("Best RMSE:", np.sqrt(-grid_search.best_score_))
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Predicting House Prices

Let's use our Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict house prices based on features like size, number of rooms, and location.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('house_prices.csv')
X = data[['size', 'rooms', 'location']]
y = data['price']

# Encode categorical variables
X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['location'])

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_train, y_train)
test_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Train RMSE: ${train_rmse:.2f}")
print(f"Test RMSE: ${test_rmse:.2f}")

# Feature importance
gbr.feature_importance(X.columns)
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Predicting Crop Yield

Another practical application of Gradient Boosting Regressor is predicting crop yield based on various environmental factors.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('crop_yield.csv')
X = data[['temperature', 'rainfall', 'soil_quality', 'fertilizer']]
y = data['yield']

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=150, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=4)
gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_train, y_train)
test_rmse = gbr.rmse(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Train RMSE: {train_rmse:.2f} tons/hectare")
print(f"Test RMSE: {test_rmse:.2f} tons/hectare")

# Feature importance
gbr.feature_importance(X.columns)
```

Slide 13: Comparing with Scikit-learn's Implementation

Let's compare our implementation with Scikit-learn's GradientBoostingRegressor to validate our results.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor as SklearnGBR

# Our implementation
our_gbr = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
our_gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)
our_rmse = our_gbr.rmse(X_test, y_test)

# Scikit-learn's implementation
sklearn_gbr = SklearnGBR(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
sklearn_gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)
sklearn_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, sklearn_gbr.predict(X_test)))

print(f"Our implementation RMSE: {our_rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Scikit-learn implementation RMSE: {sklearn_rmse:.4f}")
```
