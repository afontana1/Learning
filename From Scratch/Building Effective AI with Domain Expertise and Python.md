## Building Effective AI with Domain Expertise and Python

Slide 1: The Role of Domain Expertise in AI Development

Domain expertise plays a vital role in building effective AI systems, but it's one of several critical components. Understanding the problem domain helps in creating more accurate and relevant AI solutions.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulating the impact of domain expertise on AI performance
expertise_levels = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
ai_performance = 0.5 + 0.5 * np.tanh(5 * (expertise_levels - 0.5))

plt.plot(expertise_levels, ai_performance)
plt.xlabel('Domain Expertise Level')
plt.ylabel('AI System Performance')
plt.title('Impact of Domain Expertise on AI Performance')
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Data Quality and Quantity

High-quality, relevant data is crucial for training effective AI models. Domain expertise helps in identifying and collecting the right data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

# Split data and scale features
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

print(f"Training data shape: {X_train_scaled.shape}")
print(f"Testing data shape: {X_test_scaled.shape}")
```

Slide 3: Algorithm Selection

Choosing the right algorithm is crucial. Domain knowledge helps in selecting appropriate algorithms for specific problems.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize different models
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(),
    'Decision Tree': DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(),
    'Support Vector Machine': SVC()
}

# Train and evaluate models
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    score = model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)
    print(f"{name} accuracy: {score:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Feature Engineering

Domain expertise is invaluable in creating meaningful features that capture the essence of the problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def create_interaction_features(X):
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    interaction_features = []
    
    for i in range(n_features):
        for j in range(i+1, n_features):
            interaction = X[:, i] * X[:, j]
            interaction_features.append(interaction)
    
    return np.column_stack(interaction_features)

# Create interaction features
X_train_interactions = create_interaction_features(X_train_scaled)
X_test_interactions = create_interaction_features(X_test_scaled)

print(f"Number of new interaction features: {X_train_interactions.shape[1]}")
```

Slide 5: Model Interpretation

Understanding model outputs is crucial. Domain experts can provide valuable insights into the model's decisions.

```python
from sklearn.inspection import PartialDependenceDisplay
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

# Train a gradient boosting model
gb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Plot partial dependence for the two most important features
feature_names = X.columns.tolist()
PartialDependenceDisplay.from_estimator(gb_model, X_train_scaled, [0, 1], feature_names=feature_names)
plt.show()
```

Slide 6: Ethical Considerations

Domain experts play a crucial role in identifying and addressing ethical concerns in AI systems.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns

# Simulate predictions and true labels
y_true = np.random.randint(2, size=1000)
y_pred = np.random.randint(2, size=1000)

# Calculate confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

# Plot confusion matrix
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix: Evaluating Fairness')
plt.show()
```

Slide 7: Continuous Learning and Adaptation

AI systems need to adapt to changing environments. Domain expertise helps in identifying when and how to update models.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Initialize online learning model
sgd_model = SGDClassifier(loss='log', random_state=42)

# Simulate online learning
chunk_size = 100
n_chunks = 10

for i in range(n_chunks):
    # Simulate new data chunk
    X_chunk = np.random.randn(chunk_size, X_train.shape[1])
    y_chunk = np.random.randint(2, size=chunk_size)
    
    # Partial fit on new data
    sgd_model.partial_fit(X_chunk, y_chunk, classes=np.unique(y_train))
    
    # Evaluate on test set
    y_pred = sgd_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Chunk {i+1}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

Slide 8: Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Effective AI development often requires collaboration between domain experts, data scientists, and software engineers.

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph representing interdisciplinary collaboration
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([
    ('Domain Expert', 'Data Scientist'),
    ('Data Scientist', 'Software Engineer'),
    ('Software Engineer', 'Domain Expert'),
    ('Project Manager', 'Domain Expert'),
    ('Project Manager', 'Data Scientist'),
    ('Project Manager', 'Software Engineer')
])

# Visualize the collaboration network
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=3000, font_size=10, font_weight='bold')
edge_labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(G, 'weight')
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels)

plt.title("Interdisciplinary Collaboration in AI Development")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Medical Diagnosis

In medical AI applications, domain expertise is crucial for developing accurate diagnostic tools.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Simulate a medical dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Create and evaluate a Random Forest classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(rf_model, X, y, cv=5)

print(f"Mean accuracy: {scores.mean():.4f}")
print(f"Standard deviation: {scores.std():.4f}")

# Visualize feature importances
rf_model.fit(X, y)
feature_importance = rf_model.feature_importances_
sorted_idx = np.argsort(feature_importance)
pos = np.arange(sorted_idx.shape[0]) + .5

plt.barh(pos, feature_importance[sorted_idx], align='center')
plt.yticks(pos, [f'Feature {i}' for i in sorted_idx])
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importances in Medical Diagnosis Model')
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Natural Language Processing

Domain expertise in linguistics and specific subject areas is crucial for developing effective NLP models.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize the text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    
    # Remove stopwords and non-alphabetic tokens
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha() and token not in stop_words]
    
    return tokens

# Example text
text = "Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language."

preprocessed_tokens = preprocess_text(text)
print("Preprocessed tokens:", preprocessed_tokens)

# Calculate term frequency
from collections import Counter
term_freq = Counter(preprocessed_tokens)
print("\nTerm frequencies:")
for term, freq in term_freq.most_common(5):
    print(f"{term}: {freq}")
```

Slide 11: Balancing Domain Expertise with Technical Skills

While domain expertise is crucial, it must be balanced with technical AI and programming skills for effective development.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Define skills and their importance
skills = ['Domain Expertise', 'AI Knowledge', 'Programming', 'Data Analysis', 'Problem Solving']
importance = [0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1]  # Hypothetical importance weights

# Create a pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.pie(importance, labels=skills, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
plt.title('Balanced Skill Set for AI Development')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()

# Simulate skill levels for two hypothetical team members
team_member1 = np.array([0.9, 0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8])  # Domain expert
team_member2 = np.array([0.5, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.7])  # AI specialist

# Calculate weighted scores
score1 = np.dot(importance, team_member1)
score2 = np.dot(importance, team_member2)

print(f"Team Member 1 (Domain Expert) Score: {score1:.2f}")
print(f"Team Member 2 (AI Specialist) Score: {score2:.2f}")
```

Slide 12: Continuous Learning and Adaptation in AI Development

Both domain experts and AI developers need to continuously update their knowledge to keep up with rapid advancements.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def learning_curve(initial_knowledge, learning_rate, time):
    return initial_knowledge + (1 - initial_knowledge) * (1 - np.exp(-learning_rate * time))

time = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
domain_expert = learning_curve(0.8, 0.2, time)
ai_developer = learning_curve(0.6, 0.4, time)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(time, domain_expert, label='Domain Expert')
plt.plot(time, ai_developer, label='AI Developer')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Knowledge Level')
plt.title('Continuous Learning Curves')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Calculate knowledge gap over time
knowledge_gap = np.abs(domain_expert - ai_developer)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(time, knowledge_gap)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Knowledge Gap')
plt.title('Knowledge Gap Between Domain Expert and AI Developer')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: Challenges in Integrating Domain Expertise with AI

G.add_edges_from([
    ('Knowledge Representation', 'AI System'),
    ('Communication Barriers', 'AI System'),
    ('Evolving Domain Knowledge', 'AI System'),
    ('Technical Limitations', 'AI System'),
    ('Ethical Considerations', 'AI System')
])

# Add weights to represent difficulty
nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {('Knowledge Representation', 'AI System'): {'weight': 3},
                           ('Communication Barriers', 'AI System'): {'weight': 2},
                           ('Evolving Domain Knowledge', 'AI System'): {'weight': 4},
                           ('Technical Limitations', 'AI System'): {'weight': 3},
                           ('Ethical Considerations', 'AI System'): {'weight': 5}})
