## Building Nadam Optimizer from Scratch in Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Optimizers in Deep Learning

Optimizers play a crucial role in training deep learning models by adjusting the model's parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss function. Nadam is an optimizer that combines the advantages of two popular optimizers, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), to provide faster convergence and better generalization.

Slide 2: Understanding Momentum

Momentum is a technique used in optimization algorithms to accelerate the convergence rate by accumulating the gradients of previous steps. It helps the optimizer escape local minima and saddle points, leading to faster convergence.

```python
# Example of vanilla momentum
velocity = 0
for t in range(iterations):
    gradient = compute_gradient(parameters)
    velocity = momentum * velocity + learning_rate * gradient
    parameters -= velocity
```

Slide 3: Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

NAG is an extension of the momentum technique that provides better convergence by looking ahead and updating the parameters using the "lookahead" gradient. This helps the optimizer make more informed decisions and achieve faster convergence.

```python
# Example of NAG
velocity = 0
for t in range(iterations):
    lookahead = parameters - momentum * velocity
    gradient = compute_gradient(lookahead)
    velocity = momentum * velocity + learning_rate * gradient
    parameters -= velocity
```

Slide 4: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)

Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that computes individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients. It combines the benefits of momentum and RMSProp, making it well-suited for problems with sparse gradients or noisy data.

```python
# Example of Adam
beta1 = 0.9  # Exponential decay rate for the first moment
beta2 = 0.999  # Exponential decay rate for the second moment
m = 0  # Initialize first moment vector
v = 0  # Initialize second moment vector
for t in range(iterations):
    gradient = compute_gradient(parameters)
    m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * gradient
    v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * (gradient ** 2)
    parameters -= learning_rate * m / (np.sqrt(v) + epsilon)
```

Slide 5: Nadam Optimizer

Nadam combines the strengths of NAG and Adam by incorporating Nesterov momentum into the Adam optimizer. It leverages the benefits of both techniques, providing faster convergence and better generalization compared to either method alone.

```python
# Example of Nadam
beta1 = 0.9  # Exponential decay rate for the first moment
beta2 = 0.999  # Exponential decay rate for the second moment
m = 0  # Initialize first moment vector
v = 0  # Initialize second moment vector
for t in range(iterations):
    gradient = compute_gradient(parameters)
    m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * gradient
    v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * (gradient ** 2)
    m_hat = beta1 * m / (1 - beta1 ** t)
    v_hat = v / (1 - beta2 ** t)
    lookahead = parameters - momentum * m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + epsilon)
    gradient_lookahead = compute_gradient(lookahead)
    parameters -= learning_rate * gradient_lookahead
```

Slide 6: Implementing Nadam from Scratch

Let's dive into the implementation of the Nadam optimizer from scratch in Python. This will provide a better understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

```python
import numpy as np

class Nadam:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, epsilon=1e-8):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.beta1 = beta1
        self.beta2 = beta2
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.m = None
        self.v = None
        self.t = 0

    def update(self, parameters, gradients):
        if self.m is None:
            self.m = np.zeros_like(parameters)
            self.v = np.zeros_like(parameters)

        self.t += 1
        m_hat = self.m / (1 - self.beta1 ** self.t)
        v_hat = self.v / (1 - self.beta2 ** self.t)
        lookahead = parameters - self.beta1 * m_hat / (np.sqrt(v_hat) + self.epsilon)
        gradients_lookahead = compute_gradient(lookahead)
        self.m = self.beta1 * self.m + (1 - self.beta1) * gradients
        self.v = self.beta2 * self.v + (1 - self.beta2) * (gradients ** 2)
        parameters -= self.learning_rate * gradients_lookahead

    def get_parameters(self):
        return self.parameters
```

Slide 7: Using Nadam Optimizer

Now that we have implemented the Nadam optimizer, let's see how to use it in a deep learning model training process.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define your model
model = MyModel()

# Define the loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Create an instance of the Nadam optimizer
optimizer = Nadam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in data_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.update()
```

Slide 8: Advantages of Nadam

Nadam offers several advantages over other optimization algorithms, including:

1. Faster convergence compared to Adam and other optimizers.
2. Better generalization performance due to the combination of momentum and adaptive learning rates.
3. Handles sparse gradients and noisy data effectively.
4. Requires little tuning of hyperparameters compared to other optimizers.

Slide 9: Potential Drawbacks and Limitations

While Nadam is a powerful optimizer, it's essential to be aware of its potential drawbacks and limitations:

1. Increased computational complexity due to the additional lookahead gradient calculation.
2. May not perform well on very high-dimensional or ill-conditioned problems.
3. Sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, which may require tuning for optimal performance.

```python

```

Slide 10: Hyperparameter Tuning

Like most optimization algorithms, Nadam's performance can be influenced by the choice of hyperparameters. Here are some tips for tuning Nadam's hyperparameters:

1. Learning rate: Start with a small value (e.g., 0.001) and increase or decrease based on the model's performance.
2. Momentum coefficients (beta1 and beta2): The default values (0.9 and 0.999) often work well, but you can try different values.
3. Epsilon: A small value (e.g., 1e-8) is often used to prevent division by zero, but you can adjust it if needed.

```python
# Example of tuning learning rate
optimizer = Nadam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005)
```

Slide 11: Monitoring and Debugging

When training deep learning models with Nadam, it's important to monitor the training process and debug any issues that may arise. Here are some tips:

1. Track the loss and accuracy metrics during training to ensure the model is converging.
2. Use techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
3. Visualize the gradients and parameter updates to identify potential issues, such as vanishing or exploding gradients.
4. Debug your implementation by checking for numerical errors or inconsistencies in the computations.

```python
import torch

# Example of debugging Nadam implementation
optimizer = Nadam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in data_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        
        # Check for NaN or inf values in gradients
        if torch.isnan(optimizer.m).any() or torch.isinf(optimizer.m).any():
            print("NaN or inf detected in first moment!")
            break
        if torch.isnan(optimizer.v).any() or torch.isinf(optimizer.v).any():
            print("NaN or inf detected in second moment!")
            break
        
        optimizer.update()
```

Slide 12: Nadam in Practice

Nadam has been successfully applied to various deep learning tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Here's an example of using Nadam for image classification with PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Load pre-trained model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Modify the last layer for your classification task
num_classes = 10
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = Nadam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in data_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.update()
```
