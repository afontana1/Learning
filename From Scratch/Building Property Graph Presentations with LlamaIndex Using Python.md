## Building Property Graph Presentations with LlamaIndex Using Python
Slide 1: 

Introduction to Property Graphs with LlamaIndex

Property Graphs are a powerful data model for representing and querying highly connected data. LlamaIndex is a Python library that simplifies the process of building and querying knowledge bases using Property Graphs. In this slideshow, we'll explore the fundamentals of Property Graphs and how to leverage LlamaIndex for efficient data management and retrieval.

```python
# Import necessary modules
from llama_index import GPTVectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

# Load data from a directory
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data_dir').load_data()

# Create a vector store index
index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Query the index
query = "What is a Property Graph?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```

Slide 2: 

What are Property Graphs?

Property Graphs are a type of graph data model that represents information as nodes (entities) and relationships (edges) with properties attached to both nodes and edges. This flexible data structure is particularly useful for modeling and querying highly interconnected data, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge bases.

```python
# Example Node in a Property Graph
node = {
    "id": "1",
    "label": "Person",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30
    }
}

# Example Relationship in a Property Graph
relationship = {
    "id": "1",
    "type": "KNOWS",
    "start_node": "1",
    "end_node": "2",
    "properties": {
        "since": 2010
    }
}
```

Slide 3: 

Why Use Property Graphs?

Property Graphs offer several advantages over traditional data models, such as relational databases and key-value stores. Some key benefits include:

* Efficient representation and querying of highly connected data
* Ability to capture rich, domain-specific relationships
* Flexible schema that can evolve with changing data requirements
* Intuitive data model that closely aligns with real-world entities and relationships

```python
# Example query using LlamaIndex
query = "Find all people who know Alice and have been friends since before 2015"
result = index.query(query)
print(result)
```

Slide 4: 

LlamaIndex and Property Graphs

LlamaIndex is a Python library that simplifies the process of building and querying knowledge bases using Property Graphs. It provides a high-level interface for creating and managing vector stores, which are efficient data structures for storing and querying textual data using embeddings.

```python
# Create a vector store index from a list of texts
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

texts = SimpleDirectoryReader('data_dir').load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_texts(texts)
```

Slide 5: 

Indexing Data with LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex supports indexing data from various sources, such as text files, PDF documents, and web pages. Once the data is indexed, it can be queried using natural language questions, and LlamaIndex will retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.

```python
# Index data from a directory
from llama_index import GPTSimpleVectorIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data_dir').load_data()
index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Save the index for later use
index.save_to_disk('index.json')
```

Slide 6: 

Querying the Knowledge Base

After indexing the data, LlamaIndex allows you to query the knowledge base using natural language questions. The library leverages language models to understand the query and retrieve relevant information from the indexed data.

```python
# Load the saved index
from llama_index import GPTSimpleVectorIndex

index = GPTSimpleVectorIndex.load_from_disk('index.json')

# Query the index
query = "What is the capital of France?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```

Slide 7: 

Building a Property Graph with LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex provides tools for creating and managing Property Graphs. You can define nodes, relationships, and their properties, and then build a knowledge graph representing your data.

```python
# Define nodes and relationships
from llama_index import Node, Relation

alice = Node(text="Alice is a 30-year-old software engineer.")
bob = Node(text="Bob is a 35-year-old data scientist.")
knows = Relation(start_node=alice, end_node=bob, type="KNOWS", properties={"since": 2015})

# Build the knowledge graph
from llama_index import KnowledgeGraphIndex

index = KnowledgeGraphIndex.from_nodes([alice, bob], relations=[knows])
```

Slide 8: 

Querying the Property Graph

Once the Property Graph is constructed, LlamaIndex allows you to query it using natural language questions or graph query languages like Cypher or Gremlin. The library will traverse the graph and retrieve relevant information based on the query.

```python
# Query the knowledge graph
query = "When did Alice and Bob become friends?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```

Slide 9: 

Integrating with Language Models

LlamaIndex can integrate with various language models, such as GPT-3, to enhance the query understanding and response generation capabilities. This allows for more natural and contextual interactions with the knowledge base.

```python
# Use GPT-3 for query understanding and response generation
from llama_index import GPTKnowledgeGraphIndex

index = GPTKnowledgeGraphIndex.from_nodes([alice, bob], relations=[knows])

query = "How old is Alice's friend Bob?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```

Slide 10: 

Updating the Knowledge Base

LlamaIndex supports updating the knowledge base with new information. You can add, modify, or remove nodes and relationships dynamically, allowing the knowledge base to evolve over time.

```python
# Add a new node and relationship
charlie = Node(text="Charlie is a 28-year-old designer.")
works_with = Relation(start_node=alice, end_node=charlie, type="WORKS_WITH")

index.add_nodes([charlie])
index.add_relations([works_with])

# Query the updated knowledge base
query = "Who does Alice work with?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```

Slide 11: 

Advanced Techniques

LlamaIndex provides advanced techniques for working with Property Graphs, such as graph summarization, graph visualization, and graph analytics. These features can help you gain insights and extract valuable information from your knowledge base.

```python
# Summarize the knowledge graph
summary = index.summarize_graph()
print(summary)

# Visualize the knowledge graph
index.visualize_graph("graph.png")
```

Slide 12: 

Use Cases and Applications

Property Graphs with LlamaIndex can be applied to a wide range of domains and applications, including:

* Knowledge Management: Build and query knowledge bases for various domains
* Social Network Analysis: Model and analyze social networks and relationships
* Recommendation Systems: Represent and query item-to-item and user-to-item relationships
* Fraud Detection: Identify patterns and anomalies in highly connected data
* Biomedical Research: Model and analyze biological networks and interactions

```python
# Example: Recommendation System
from llama_index import GPTKnowledgeGraphIndex

# Define nodes for users, items, and their relationships
users = [Node(text=f"User {i}") for i in range(10)]
items = [Node(text=f"Item {i}") for i in range(20)]
relations = [Relation(start_node=users[i], end_node=items[j], type="PURCHASED") for i in range(10) for j in range(5)]

# Build the knowledge graph
index = GPTKnowledgeGraphIndex.from_nodes(users + items, relations=relations)

# Query for recommendations
query = "What items should User 3 consider based on their purchase history?"
response = index.query(query)
print(response)
```
