## Introduction to Docker and Python Integration

Slide 1: Introduction to Docker and Python Integration

Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies application deployment and management. This slideshow will cover the basics of integrating Python applications with Docker, making it easier to build, ship, and run Python applications consistently across different environments.

Slide 2: What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to package applications with all their dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can run consistently on any machine with Docker installed.

```
# Example of running a Python script in a Docker container
docker run -it --rm --name my-python-script -v "$PWD":/app -w /app python:3.9 python my_script.py
```

Slide 3: Docker and Python Integration Benefits

Integrating Python applications with Docker provides several benefits:

1. Consistent environment: Docker ensures your Python application runs the same way across different platforms and environments.
2. Reproducible builds: Docker images capture the entire application and its dependencies, making builds reproducible.
3. Lightweight and efficient: Docker containers are lightweight and use fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines.

Slide 4: Installing Docker

Before we can start integrating Python with Docker, we need to install Docker on our system. Visit the official Docker website ([https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)) and follow the instructions for your specific operating system.

```bash
# Example of checking Docker installation
docker --version
```

Slide 5: Docker Images

Docker images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. They contain the application code, dependencies, and runtime environment.

```docker
# Example Dockerfile for a Python application
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

Slide 6: Building Docker Images

Docker images are built using a Dockerfile, which specifies the instructions for creating the image. The `docker build` command is used to build an image from a Dockerfile.

```bash
# Example of building a Docker image
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

Slide 7: Running Docker Containers

Once you have built a Docker image, you can create and run containers from that image using the `docker run` command.

```bash
# Example of running a Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-python-app
```

Slide 8: Mounting Volumes

Docker volumes allow you to persist data and share data between the host and the container. This is useful for development, as you can mount your local code directory as a volume and see changes reflected in the running container.

```bash
# Example of mounting a volume
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd):/app my-python-app
```

Slide 9: Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services and their dependencies in a YAML file.

```yaml
# Example Docker Compose file
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```

Slide 10: Running with Docker Compose

Once you have defined your services in a Docker Compose file, you can start them using the `docker-compose up` command.

```bash
# Example of running services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

Slide 11: Development Workflow with Docker

Docker can be integrated into your Python development workflow to streamline the process of building, running, and testing your applications.

1. Write your Python code and Dockerfile
2. Build the Docker image
3. Run the Docker container and test your application
4. Commit your changes and push to a repository

Slide 12: Continuous Integration and Deployment

Docker can be easily integrated with Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-python-app .
      - name: Run tests
        run: docker run my-python-app pytest
```

Slide 13: Docker Registries

Docker images can be stored and shared via Docker registries, such as Docker Hub or private registries. This allows you to distribute your Python applications and dependencies easily.

```bash
# Example of pushing an image to Docker Hub
docker push myusername/my-python-app:latest
```
