## Supercharge Your Python with Generators and Iterators
Slide 1: Introduction to Generators and Iterators

Generators and iterators are powerful tools in Python that allow for efficient handling of large datasets and memory-conscious programming. They provide a way to work with sequences of data without loading the entire sequence into memory at once. This makes them ideal for processing big data or creating data pipelines that can handle infinite sequences.

```python
# Simple generator function
def count_up_to(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        yield i
        i += 1

# Using the generator
for num in count_up_to(5):
    print(num)
```

Slide 2: Iterators Explained

An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It implements two methods: **iter**() and **next**(). The **iter**() method returns the iterator object itself, while **next**() returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more items to return, it raises a StopIteration exception.

```python
class SimpleIterator:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.counter = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.counter < self.limit:
            self.counter += 1
            return self.counter
        raise StopIteration

# Using the iterator
simple_iter = SimpleIterator(3)
print(next(simple_iter))
print(next(simple_iter))
print(next(simple_iter))
```

Slide 4: Generators: Simplified Iterators

Generators are a simpler way to create iterators. They are functions that use the yield keyword instead of return. When called, they return a generator object that can be iterated over. Generators automatically implement the iterator protocol, making them more concise and easier to write than full iterator classes.

```python
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator
for fib in fibonacci_generator(5):
    print(fib)
```

Slide 6: Generator Expressions

Generator expressions are a concise way to create generators. They have a syntax similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets. Generator expressions are memory-efficient as they generate values on-the-fly instead of creating a whole list in memory.

```python
# Generator expression
squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(5))

# Using the generator expression
print(sum(squares_gen))

# Comparing with list comprehension
squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(sum(squares_list))
```

Slide 8: Memory Efficiency of Generators

Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-demand, rather than storing all values in memory. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences. Let's compare the memory usage of a generator versus a list comprehension.

```python
import sys

# Generator
def squares_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i ** 2

# List comprehension
squares_list = [i ** 2 for i in range(1000000)]

# Compare memory usage
gen = squares_generator(1000000)
print(f"Generator size: {sys.getsizeof(gen)} bytes")
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(squares_list)} bytes")
```

Slide 9: Results for: Memory Efficiency of Generators

```
Generator size: 112 bytes
List size: 8448728 bytes
```

Slide 10: Infinite Sequences with Generators

Generators can be used to create infinite sequences, which is not possible with regular lists. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to generate data on-the-fly or work with theoretical infinite series.

```python
def prime_generator():
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    n = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(n):
            yield n
        n += 1

# Get the first 10 prime numbers
primes = prime_generator()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(primes))
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Data Processing Pipeline

Generators are excellent for creating data processing pipelines. They allow you to chain multiple operations together efficiently, processing data in small chunks. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or streaming data.

```python
def read_large_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()

def parse_line(line):
    return line.split(',')

def filter_data(items):
    return (item for item in items if len(item) > 2)

def process_data(file_path):
    lines = read_large_file(file_path)
    parsed_lines = map(parse_line, lines)
    filtered_data = filter_data(parsed_lines)
    
    for item in filtered_data:
        yield f"Processed: {item}"

# Simulate processing a large CSV file
for processed_item in process_data('large_data.csv'):
    print(processed_item)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Sensor Data Simulation

Generators can be used to simulate real-time sensor data, which is useful for testing IoT applications or data analysis systems. In this example, we'll create a generator that simulates temperature readings from multiple sensors.

```python
import random
import time

def temperature_sensor(sensor_id, mean_temp, std_dev):
    while True:
        temperature = random.gauss(mean_temp, std_dev)
        yield (sensor_id, temperature, time.time())

def multi_sensor_readings(num_sensors):
    sensors = [temperature_sensor(i, 20 + i, 2) for i in range(num_sensors)]
    while True:
        for sensor in sensors:
            yield next(sensor)

# Simulate readings from 3 sensors
sensor_data = multi_sensor_readings(3)
for _ in range(10):
    sensor_id, temp, timestamp = next(sensor_data)
    print(f"Sensor {sensor_id}: {temp:.2f}Â°C at {timestamp:.2f}")
    time.sleep(0.5)
```
