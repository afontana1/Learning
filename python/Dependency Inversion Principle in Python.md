## Dependency Inversion Principle in Python:
Slide 1: Dependency Inversion Principle in Python

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the core principles of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Slide 2: Understanding Dependencies

In traditional programming, higher-level modules often depend on lower-level modules, creating tight coupling. This makes it difficult to change or extend the lower-level modules without impacting the higher-level modules. DIP aims to address this issue by introducing an abstraction layer.

```python
# Traditional approach (violates DIP)
class EmailSender:
    def send_email(self, message):
        # Implementation details for sending email

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_sender = EmailSender()

    def send_notification(self, message):
        self.email_sender.send_email(message)
```

Slide 3: Introducing Abstraction

To follow the DIP, we need to introduce an abstraction layer (e.g., an interface or an abstract base class) that defines the contract between the higher-level and lower-level modules. Both modules will then depend on this abstraction.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Messenger(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send_message(self, message):
        pass
```

Slide 4: Implementing the Abstraction

The lower-level module (e.g., EmailSender) implements the abstraction (Messenger interface) and provides the concrete implementation details.

```python
class EmailSender(Messenger):
    def send_message(self, message):
        # Implementation details for sending email
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")
```

Slide 5: Higher-level Module Depends on Abstraction

The higher-level module (NotificationService) now depends on the abstraction (Messenger interface) instead of the concrete implementation (EmailSender). This decouples the higher-level module from the lower-level module.

```python
class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self, messenger: Messenger):
        self.messenger = messenger

    def send_notification(self, message):
        self.messenger.send_message(message)
```

Slide 6: Using the Notification Service

To use the NotificationService, you can instantiate it with any concrete implementation of the Messenger interface, such as EmailSender.

```python
email_sender = EmailSender()
notification_service = NotificationService(email_sender)
notification_service.send_notification("Hello, World!")
```

Slide 7: Benefits of DIP

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle, you can achieve:

1. Loose coupling between modules
2. Improved flexibility and extensibility
3. Better testability (easier to mock dependencies)

```python
# Easier to mock the Messenger for testing
class MockMessenger(Messenger):
    def send_message(self, message):
        print(f"Mock: Sending message: {message}")
```

Slide 8: Example: Logging

Let's consider another example where we introduce an abstraction (Logger interface) for logging messages. Both the application and the logging implementation will depend on this abstraction.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Logger(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, message):
        pass
```

Slide 9: Implementing Logger

We can implement different logging strategies, such as console logging or file logging, by implementing the Logger interface.

```python
class ConsoleLogger(Logger):
    def log(self, message):
        print(message)

class FileLogger(Logger):
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def log(self, message):
        with open(self.file_path, 'a') as file:
            file.write(message + '\n')
```

Slide 10: Using the Logger

In the application code, we can depend on the Logger abstraction and inject the desired logging implementation.

```python
class Application:
    def __init__(self, logger: Logger):
        self.logger = logger

    def run(self):
        self.logger.log("Application started.")
        # Application logic
        self.logger.log("Application finished.")
```

Slide 11: Putting It All Together

Here's how we can use the Application class with different logging implementations:

```python
# Console logging
console_logger = ConsoleLogger()
app = Application(console_logger)
app.run()

# File logging
file_logger = FileLogger('app.log')
app = Application(file_logger)
app.run()
```

Slide 12: Dependency Injection

Dependency Inversion Principle often goes hand-in-hand with Dependency Injection, a design pattern that promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies into a class instead of creating them within the class itself.

```python
# Dependency Injection
def main():
    file_logger = FileLogger('app.log')
    app = Application(file_logger)
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Slide 13: Dependency Injection Containers

In larger applications, you can use Dependency Injection Containers (e.g., Python's dependency-injector library) to manage and inject dependencies automatically.

```python
import dependency_injector.containers as containers
import dependency_injector.providers as providers

class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    config = providers.Configuration()
    logger = providers.Singleton(
        FileLogger,
        file_path=config.log_file_path
    )
    application = providers.Factory(
        Application,
        logger=logger
    )
```

Slide 14: Conclusion

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle and using Dependency Injection, you can create more modular, flexible, and testable applications in Python. This principle promotes loose coupling, code reusability, and easier maintenance of your codebase.
