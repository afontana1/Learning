## Diagrams as Code Turning Python into Architecture
Slide 1: Introduction to Diagrams as Code

Diagrams as Code is a powerful approach that allows developers to create cloud system architecture diagrams using Python code. This method eliminates the need for separate design tools and enables seamless integration of diagram creation into the development workflow. By leveraging Python's simplicity and flexibility, developers can quickly prototype and visualize complex cloud architectures.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

with Diagram("Web Service", show=False):
    ELB("lb") >> EC2("web") >> RDS("userdb")
```

Slide 2: Setting Up the Environment

To get started with Diagrams as Code, we need to set up our Python environment. First, install the required library using pip. Then, import the necessary modules to create your first diagram.

```python
# Install the diagrams library
!pip install diagrams

# Import required modules
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

print("Environment set up successfully!")
```

Slide 3: Creating a Simple Diagram

Let's create a basic diagram representing a web service with a load balancer, web server, and database. This example demonstrates how to define nodes and their relationships using Python code.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

with Diagram("Simple Web Service", show=False):
    lb = ELB("Load Balancer")
    web = EC2("Web Server")
    db = RDS("Database")
    
    lb >> web >> db

print("Diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 4: Customizing Node Attributes

Diagrams as Code allows for easy customization of node attributes such as labels, colors, and styles. This flexibility enables developers to create more informative and visually appealing diagrams.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Edge
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

with Diagram("Customized Web Service", show=False):
    lb = ELB("Load Balancer")
    web = EC2("Web Server")
    db = RDS("Database")
    
    lb >> Edge(color="red", style="dashed") >> web
    web >> Edge(label="Read/Write") >> db

print("Customized diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 5: Grouping and Clustering

Organize complex architectures by grouping related components using clusters. This feature helps in creating more structured and readable diagrams, especially for large-scale systems.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB

with Diagram("Clustered Web Service", show=False):
    lb = ELB("Load Balancer")
    
    with Cluster("Web Tier"):
        web_1 = EC2("Web Server 1")
        web_2 = EC2("Web Server 2")
    
    with Cluster("Database Tier"):
        db_master = RDS("Master")
        db_slave = RDS("Slave")
    
    lb >> [web_1, web_2]
    [web_1, web_2] >> db_master
    db_master >> db_slave

print("Clustered diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 6: Multi-Provider Diagrams

Diagrams as Code supports multiple cloud providers, allowing developers to create diagrams that represent multi-cloud or hybrid cloud architectures. This flexibility is crucial for modern, complex infrastructure designs.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.azure.database import SQLDatabases
from diagrams.gcp.network import LoadBalancing

with Diagram("Multi-Cloud Architecture", show=False):
    lb = LoadBalancing("GCP Load Balancer")
    web = EC2("AWS EC2 Instance")
    db = SQLDatabases("Azure SQL Database")
    
    lb >> web >> db

print("Multi-cloud diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 7: Generating Diagrams in Jupyter Notebooks

Diagrams as Code integrates seamlessly with Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for interactive diagram creation and visualization. This feature is particularly useful for data scientists and analysts working on cloud-based data pipelines.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.aws.analytics import EMR
from diagrams.aws.storage import S3

# This code would be run in a Jupyter Notebook cell
with Diagram("Data Pipeline", show=True):
    s3 = S3("Raw Data")
    emr = EMR("Processing")
    output = S3("Processed Data")
    
    s3 >> emr >> output

print("Diagram rendered in Jupyter Notebook")
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: E-commerce Platform

Let's create a diagram representing a typical e-commerce platform architecture using Diagrams as Code. This example showcases how to model a more complex, real-world system.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2, ECS
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS, ElastiCache
from diagrams.aws.network import ELB, Route53
from diagrams.aws.storage import S3

with Diagram("E-commerce Platform", show=False):
    dns = Route53("DNS")
    lb = ELB("Load Balancer")

    with Cluster("Web Tier"):
        web_servers = [EC2("Web Server 1"),
                       EC2("Web Server 2")]

    with Cluster("Application Tier"):
        app_servers = ECS("Container Services")

    with Cluster("Database Tier"):
        db_primary = RDS("Primary DB")
        db_replica = RDS("Replica DB")

    cache = ElastiCache("Cache")
    storage = S3("Static Assets")

    dns >> lb >> web_servers >> app_servers
    app_servers >> db_primary >> db_replica
    app_servers >> cache
    web_servers >> storage

print("E-commerce platform diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: IoT Data Processing

This example demonstrates how to use Diagrams as Code to visualize an Internet of Things (IoT) data processing architecture, showcasing the tool's versatility in representing various types of cloud systems.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster
from diagrams.aws.iot import IotCore, IotAnalytics, IotSiteWise
from diagrams.aws.analytics import KinesisDataStreams, KinesisDataAnalytics
from diagrams.aws.storage import S3
from diagrams.aws.database import Timestream

with Diagram("IoT Data Processing", show=False):
    with Cluster("IoT Devices"):
        devices = [IotCore("Device 1"),
                   IotCore("Device 2"),
                   IotCore("Device 3")]

    ingestion = KinesisDataStreams("Data Ingestion")
    processing = KinesisDataAnalytics("Real-time Processing")
    storage = S3("Raw Data Storage")
    timeseries_db = Timestream("Time Series DB")
    analytics = IotAnalytics("IoT Analytics")
    insights = IotSiteWise("IoT SiteWise")

    devices >> ingestion >> processing
    ingestion >> storage
    processing >> timeseries_db
    timeseries_db >> analytics >> insights

print("IoT data processing diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 10: Extending Diagrams with Custom Nodes

Diagrams as Code allows for the creation of custom nodes, enabling developers to represent specific components or services not included in the default provider libraries. This extensibility ensures that the tool can adapt to unique architectural needs.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Node

class CustomNode(Node):
    def __init__(self, label, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(label, **kwargs)

with Diagram("Custom Architecture", show=False):
    custom_service = CustomNode("My Custom Service")
    downstream = CustomNode("Downstream Service")
    
    custom_service >> downstream

print("Diagram with custom nodes created successfully!")
```

Slide 11: Implementing Nested Clusters

Complex architectures often require nested structures to represent hierarchical relationships. Diagrams as Code supports nested clusters, allowing for the creation of intricate, multi-level diagrams.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.network import VPC

with Diagram("Nested VPC Architecture", show=False):
    with Cluster("Region"):
        with Cluster("VPC"):
            with Cluster("Public Subnet"):
                EC2("Public EC2")
            
            with Cluster("Private Subnet"):
                with Cluster("App Layer"):
                    EC2("App Server 1")
                    EC2("App Server 2")
                
                with Cluster("Database Layer"):
                    EC2("DB Server")

print("Nested cluster diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 12: Generating Dynamic Diagrams

Diagrams as Code can be integrated with dynamic data sources to generate up-to-date architecture diagrams automatically. This example demonstrates how to create a diagram based on a hypothetical configuration file.

```python
import json
from diagrams import Diagram, Node

# Simulating a configuration file
config = {
    "services": [
        {"name": "Web", "type": "EC2"},
        {"name": "API", "type": "Lambda"},
        {"name": "Database", "type": "RDS"}
    ],
    "connections": [
        ["Web", "API"],
        ["API", "Database"]
    ]
}

with Diagram("Dynamic Architecture", show=False):
    nodes = {svc["name"]: Node(svc["name"]) for svc in config["services"]}
    
    for conn in config["connections"]:
        nodes[conn[0]] >> nodes[conn[1]]

print("Dynamic diagram created successfully!")
```

Slide 13: Best Practices and Tips

When using Diagrams as Code, consider these best practices:

1.  Organize your code into logical sections for better readability.
2.  Use meaningful names for nodes and clusters.
3.  Leverage color coding and custom styles to highlight important components.
4.  Keep diagrams focused on a specific aspect of the architecture to avoid overcrowding.
5.  Use version control to track changes in your architecture over time.

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster, Edge
from diagrams.aws.compute import EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS

with Diagram("Best Practices Example", show=False):
    with Cluster("Application Tier"):
        app = EC2("App Server")
    
    with Cluster("Database Tier"):
        db = RDS("Database")
    
    app >> Edge(color="red", style="bold", label="Secure Connection") >> db

print("Best practices diagram created successfully!")
```
