## Sorting Algorithms! Essential Computer Science Tools

Slide 1: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to arrange data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. These algorithms take an unsorted array as input and return a sorted array as output. The output array is a permutation of the input array, ensuring that all elements are present and in the desired order.

```python
def simple_sort(arr):
    return sorted(arr)

# Example usage
unsorted = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_arr = simple_sort(unsorted)
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 2: Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

```python
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
unsorted = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(unsorted.copy())
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 3: Merge Sort

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer strategy. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.

```python
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

# Example usage
unsorted = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(unsorted)
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 4: Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

```python
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[0]
        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]
        return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)

# Example usage
unsorted = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
sorted_arr = quick_sort(unsorted)
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 5: Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.

```python
    largest = i
    l = 2 * i + 1
    r = 2 * i + 2

    if l < n and arr[i] < arr[l]:
        largest = l

    if r < n and arr[largest] < arr[r]:
        largest = r

    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

    return arr

# Example usage
unsorted = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
sorted_arr = heap_sort(unsorted.copy())
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 6: Selection Sort

Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted portion at the left end and an unsorted portion at the right end. Initially, the sorted portion is empty and the unsorted portion is the entire list.

```python
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[min_idx] > arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr

# Example usage
unsorted = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
sorted_arr = selection_sort(unsorted.copy())
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```

Slide 7: Time Complexity Analysis

Understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms is crucial for choosing the right algorithm for a specific task. Here's a comparison of the time complexities for the sorting algorithms we've discussed:

```python
import numpy as np

def plot_time_complexity():
    algorithms = ['Bubble Sort', 'Merge Sort', 'Quick Sort', 'Heap Sort', 'Selection Sort']
    best_case = [r'$O(n)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n^2)$']
    average_case = [r'$O(n^2)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n^2)$']
    worst_case = [r'$O(n^2)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n^2)$', r'$O(n \log n)$', r'$O(n^2)$']

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))
    x = np.arange(len(algorithms))
    width = 0.25

    ax.bar(x - width, best_case, width, label='Best Case')
    ax.bar(x, average_case, width, label='Average Case')
    ax.bar(x + width, worst_case, width, label='Worst Case')

    ax.set_ylabel('Time Complexity')
    ax.set_title('Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms')
    ax.set_xticks(x)
    ax.set_xticklabels(algorithms, rotation=45, ha='right')
    ax.legend()

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_time_complexity()
```

Slide 8: Space Complexity Analysis

Space complexity is another important factor to consider when choosing a sorting algorithm. It refers to the amount of extra space required by the algorithm in addition to the input array.

```python

def plot_space_complexity():
    algorithms = ['Bubble Sort', 'Merge Sort', 'Quick Sort', 'Heap Sort', 'Selection Sort']
    space_complexity = ['O(1)', 'O(n)', 'O(log n)', 'O(1)', 'O(1)']

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.bar(algorithms, [1, 2, 1.5, 1, 1])  # Using arbitrary values for visualization

    ax.set_ylabel('Space Complexity')
    ax.set_title('Space Complexity of Sorting Algorithms')
    ax.set_ylim(0, 2.5)

    for i, v in enumerate(space_complexity):
        ax.text(i, 0.1, v, ha='center', va='bottom')

    plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_space_complexity()
```

Slide 9: Stability in Sorting Algorithms

A sorting algorithm is considered stable if it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. This property is important in certain applications where the original order of equal elements needs to be preserved.

```python
    # Create a list of tuples (name, score)
    data = [("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 90), ("Charlie", 85), ("David", 80)]
    
    # Sort the data based on scores
    sorted_data = sort_function(data, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    print(f"Original data: {data}")
    print(f"Sorted data: {sorted_data}")
    
    # Check if Alice still comes before Charlie
    alice_index = next(i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_data) if v[0] == "Alice")
    charlie_index = next(i for i, v in enumerate(sorted_data) if v[0] == "Charlie")
    
    print(f"Is the sort stable? {'Yes' if alice_index < charlie_index else 'No'}")

# Example usage
demonstrate_stability(sorted)  # Python's built-in sorted function is stable
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Library Book Sorting

Consider a library that needs to sort its books. The library wants to sort books first by genre, then by author's last name, and finally by title. This is a perfect scenario for a stable sorting algorithm.

```python
    def __init__(self, title, author, genre):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.genre = genre

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author} ({self.genre})"

def sort_library_books(books):
    # Sort by title
    books = sorted(books, key=lambda x: x.title)
    # Sort by author
    books = sorted(books, key=lambda x: x.author)
    # Sort by genre
    books = sorted(books, key=lambda x: x.genre)
    return books

# Example usage
library = [
    Book("1984", "Orwell", "Fiction"),
    Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Lee", "Fiction"),
    Book("The Great Gatsby", "Fitzgerald", "Fiction"),
    Book("A Brief History of Time", "Hawking", "Non-Fiction"),
    Book("The Catcher in the Rye", "Salinger", "Fiction")
]

sorted_library = sort_library_books(library)
for book in sorted_library:
    print(book)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Playlist Sorting

Music streaming services often need to sort playlists based on multiple criteria. Let's implement a sorting function that arranges songs by genre, then by artist, and finally by song title.

```python
    def __init__(self, title, artist, genre):
        self.title = title
        self.artist = artist
        self.genre = genre

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.title} - {self.artist} ({self.genre})"

def sort_playlist(playlist):
    return sorted(playlist, key=lambda x: (x.genre, x.artist, x.title))

# Example usage
playlist = [
    Song("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "Rock"),
    Song("Stairway to Heaven", "Led Zeppelin", "Rock"),
    Song("Thriller", "Michael Jackson", "Pop"),
    Song("Billie Jean", "Michael Jackson", "Pop"),
    Song("Sweet Child o' Mine", "Guns N' Roses", "Rock")
]

sorted_playlist = sort_playlist(playlist)
for song in sorted_playlist:
    print(song)
```

Slide 12: Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm

Selecting the appropriate sorting algorithm depends on various factors such as the size of the dataset, the nature of the data, and the specific requirements of the application. Here's a guide to help choose the right algorithm:

```python
    if data_size < 50:
        return "Insertion Sort (for very small datasets)"
    elif is_nearly_sorted:
        return "Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort"
    elif memory_constraint:
        if stability_required:
            return "Merge Sort (in-place version)"
        else:
            return "Heap Sort"
    else:
        if stability_required:
            return "Merge Sort"
        else:
            return "Quick Sort (with good pivot selection)"

# Example usage
print(recommend_sort_algorithm(1000, is_nearly_sorted=True))
print(recommend_sort_algorithm(1000000, memory_constraint=True))
print(recommend_sort_algorithm(1000000, stability_required=True))
```

Slide 13: Implementing Custom Sorting

Python's built-in `sorted()` function and `list.sort()` method allow for custom sorting using the `key` parameter. This is useful when sorting complex objects or when you need to sort based on specific criteria.

```python
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.name} ({self.age})"

people = [
    Person("Alice", 30),
    Person("Bob", 25),
    Person("Charlie", 35),
    Person("David", 28)
]

# Sort by age
sorted_by_age = sorted(people, key=lambda x: x.age)
print("Sorted by age:", sorted_by_age)

# Sort by name length, then by name
sorted_by_name = sorted(people, key=lambda x: (len(x.name), x.name))
print("Sorted by name length, then name:", sorted_by_name)
```

Slide 14: Parallel Sorting Algorithms

Parallel sorting algorithms leverage multiple processors or cores to sort data more quickly than sequential algorithms. These are particularly useful for large datasets where traditional algorithms may become inefficient.

```python
import random

def parallel_quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        left_future = executor.submit(parallel_quicksort, left)
        right_future = executor.submit(parallel_quicksort, right)
        
        left_sorted = left_future.result()
        right_sorted = right_future.result()
    
    return left_sorted + middle + right_sorted

# Example usage
arr = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(100)]
sorted_arr = parallel_quicksort(arr)
print(f"First 10 sorted elements: {sorted_arr[:10]}")
```

Slide 15: Sorting in Database Systems

Database management systems often use specialized sorting algorithms optimized for disk-based operations. These algorithms, such as external merge sort, are designed to handle data that doesn't fit into memory.

```python
    # Step 1: Split the file into sorted chunks
    chunk_files = []
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
        chunk = []
        for line in f:
            chunk.append(int(line.strip()))
            if len(chunk) == chunk_size:
                chunk.sort()
                temp_file = f'temp_{len(chunk_files)}.txt'
                with open(temp_file, 'w') as temp:
                    for num in chunk:
                        temp.write(f"{num}\n")
                chunk_files.append(temp_file)
                chunk = []
    
    # Step 2: Merge the sorted chunks
    with open(output_file, 'w') as out:
        chunks = [open(f) for f in chunk_files]
        values = [int(f.readline().strip()) for f in chunks]
        while any(values):
            min_value = min(v for v in values if v is not None)
            min_index = values.index(min_value)
            out.write(f"{min_value}\n")
            next_line = chunks[min_index].readline().strip()
            values[min_index] = int(next_line) if next_line else None

    # Clean up temporary files
    for f in chunks:
        f.close()
    for f in chunk_files:
        import os
        os.remove(f)

# Usage example (not executed due to file operations):
# external_merge_sort('large_input.txt', 'sorted_output.txt', 1000000)
```

Slide 16: Sorting Networks

Sorting networks are a class of sorting algorithms that sort a fixed number of inputs using a fixed sequence of comparisons. They are particularly useful in hardware implementations and parallel processing.

```python
    if a[i] > a[j]:
        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]

def sorting_network_4(a):
    # A simple sorting network for 4 elements
    compare_and_swap(a, 0, 1)
    compare_and_swap(a, 2, 3)
    compare_and_swap(a, 0, 2)
    compare_and_swap(a, 1, 3)
    compare_and_swap(a, 1, 2)
    return a

# Example usage
unsorted = [3, 1, 4, 2]
sorted_arr = sorting_network_4(unsorted)
print(f"Unsorted: {unsorted}")
print(f"Sorted: {sorted_arr}")
```
