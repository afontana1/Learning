## Concurrency and Parallelism in Python Slideshow Guide
Slide 1: 
Introduction to Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism are fundamental concepts in modern computing, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and improved performance. While concurrency deals with managing multiple tasks or threads of execution, parallelism involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously on different processors or cores.

```python
import threading
import time

def worker():
    print(f"Worker thread started: {threading.current_thread().name}")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Worker thread finished: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Create and start two worker threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

print("Main thread waiting for worker threads to finish...")

# Wait for the worker threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("All worker threads have finished.")
```

Slide 2: 
Threading in Python

Python's `threading` module enables the creation and management of threads within a single process. Threads allow concurrent execution of multiple tasks, sharing the same memory space. However, Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.

```python
import threading

# Define a function to be executed by the thread
def print_numbers():
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

# Create and start two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for the threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Done!")
```

Slide 3: 
Multiprocessing in Python

Python's `multiprocessing` module allows the creation of separate processes, each with its own memory space and GIL. This enables true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, as processes can run concurrently on multiple cores or processors.

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
        result = pool.map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        print(result)
```

Slide 4: 
I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound Tasks

I/O-bound tasks involve waiting for input/output operations, such as reading from a file or network. CPU-bound tasks involve intensive computational work. Python's threading is suitable for I/O-bound tasks, while multiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks.

```python
import time
import threading

# I/O-bound task
def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
    print(f"File '{file_path}' read successfully.")

# CPU-bound task
def compute_sum(n):
    total = sum(range(n))
    print(f"Sum of numbers up to {n} is {total}.")

# Create threads for I/O-bound tasks
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=read_file, args=('file1.txt',))
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=read_file, args=('file2.txt',))

# Create processes for CPU-bound tasks
process1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=compute_sum, args=(10000000,))
process2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=compute_sum, args=(20000000,))

# Start threads and processes
thread1.start()
thread2.start()
process1.start()
process2.start()

# Wait for threads and processes to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()
process1.join()
process2.join()
```

Slide 5: 
Thread Synchronization

When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, race conditions and data corruption can occur. Python provides various synchronization primitives, such as locks, semaphores, and events, to ensure thread safety.

```python
import threading

# Shared resource
counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:
            counter += 1

# Create and start two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Wait for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
```

Slide 6: 
Thread Pools

Thread pools provide a way to manage and reuse a pool of worker threads, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task. Python's `concurrent.futures` module offers a high-level interface for working with thread pools.

```python
import concurrent.futures

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        results = [executor.submit(square, n) for n in numbers]

        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(results):
            result = future.result()
            print(result)
```

Slide 7: 
Event-Driven Programming with Asyncio

Python's `asyncio` module provides an event loop and coroutines for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It allows efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks and enables cooperative multitasking.

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching data from {url}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulating I/O operation
    return f"Data from {url}"

async def main():
    urls = ["http://example.com", "http://python.org", "http://google.com"]
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch_data(url)) for url in urls]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Slide 8: 
Producer-Consumer Pattern

The producer-consumer pattern is a common concurrency design pattern where one or more producer threads generate data, and one or more consumer threads process the data. Python's `queue` module provides a thread-safe implementation of queues for inter-thread communication.

```python
import threading
import queue
import random
import time

# Producer thread
def producer(q, event):
    while not event.is_set():
        data = random.randint(1, 100)
        q.put(data)
        print(f"Produced: {data}")
        time.sleep(1)

# Consumer thread
def consumer(q, event):
    while not event.is_set() or not q.empty():
        try:
            data = q.get(timeout=1)
            print(f"Consumed: {data}")
        except queue.Empty:
            continue

# Create a queue and an event
q = queue.Queue()
event = threading.Event()

# Create and start producer and consumer threads
producer_thread = threading.Thread(target=producer, args=(q, event))
consumer_thread = threading.Thread(target=consumer, args=(q, event))

producer_thread.start()
consumer_thread.start()

# Wait for some time before stopping the threads
time.sleep(10)
event.set()

# Wait for threads to finish
producer_thread.join()
consumer_thread.join()
```

Slide 9: 
Parallel Processing with Multiprocessing Pool

The `multiprocessing` module in Python provides a `Pool` class for parallel execution of tasks across multiple processes. It simplifies the creation and management of a pool of worker processes, automatically distributing tasks among them.

```python
import multiprocessing

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    results = pool.map(square, numbers)
    print(results)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
```

Slide 10: 
Inter-Process Communication

When working with multiple processes, communication between them is often necessary. Python's `multiprocessing` module provides various synchronization primitives, such as queues, pipes, and shared memory, to facilitate inter-process communication and data sharing.

```python
from multiprocessing import Process, Queue

def producer(q):
    for i in range(10):
        q.put(i)
        print(f"Producer put {i} in the queue.")

def consumer(q):
    while True:
        item = q.get()
        if item is None:
            break
        print(f"Consumer got {item} from the queue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue = Queue()
    producer_process = Process(target=producer, args=(queue,))
    consumer_process = Process(target=consumer, args=(queue,))

    producer_process.start()
    consumer_process.start()

    producer_process.join()
    queue.put(None)  # Signal the consumer to stop
    consumer_process.join()
```

Slide 11: 
Distributed Computing with Dask

Dask is a parallel computing library for Python that scales from multi-core machines to distributed clusters. It provides high-level APIs for parallel data processing, allowing you to write code once and run it in various environments, including multi-core, distributed, or GPU-accelerated systems.

```python
import dask.bag as db

# Create a Dask Bag from a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
bag = db.from_sequence(numbers)

# Perform parallel operations
squared = bag.map(lambda x: x ** 2)
total = squared.sum().compute()

print(f"Sum of squared numbers: {total}")
```

Slide 12: 
Concurrent File Operations

Python's `concurrent.futures` module provides a high-level interface for working with thread and process pools, making it easier to execute concurrent file operations, such as reading, writing, or processing multiple files simultaneously.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import os

def process_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
        # Perform some processing on the data
        processed_data = data.upper()
        return processed_data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_paths = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_file, path) for path in file_paths]

        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            processed_data = future.result()
            print(processed_data)
```

Slide 13: 
Asynchronous Web Scraping

Python's `aiohttp` and `asyncio` libraries enable asynchronous web scraping, allowing concurrent fetching of web pages without blocking the main thread. This approach can significantly improve performance when scraping multiple URLs.

```python
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def fetch_url(url, session):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        html = await response.text()
        print(f"Fetched {url}: {len(html)} characters")
        return html

async def main():
    urls = [
        "http://example.com",
        "http://python.org",
        "http://google.com"
    ]

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch_url(url, session)) for url in urls]
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
