## Simplify Resource Management with Python Context Managers
Slide 1: Introduction to Context Managers

Context managers in Python are powerful tools that help manage resources efficiently and automatically. They ensure proper setup and cleanup of resources, reducing the risk of errors and resource leaks. Let's explore how context managers work and why they're essential for writing clean, maintainable code.

```python
# Basic structure of a context manager
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, Context Managers!')

# The file is automatically closed after the 'with' block
```

Slide 2: The 'with' Statement

The 'with' statement is the cornerstone of context management in Python. It provides a clean and readable way to work with resources that need to be properly managed, such as files, network connections, or database cursors.

```python
# Without context manager
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()
file.close()

# With context manager
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
# File is automatically closed
```

Slide 3: Built-in Context Managers

Python provides several built-in context managers for common operations. These include file handling, threading locks, and temporary directory management. Let's look at an example using the 'threading.Lock()' context manager.

```python
import threading

lock = threading.Lock()

def increment_counter(counter):
    with lock:
        counter.value += 1

counter = threading.Value('i', 0)
threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment_counter, args=(counter,)) for _ in range(10)]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter.value}")
```

```
Final counter value: 10
```

Slide 5: Creating Custom Context Managers

While built-in context managers are useful, you can also create custom context managers to suit your specific needs. There are two ways to create custom context managers: using a class or using the 'contextlib.contextmanager' decorator.

```python
class CustomContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")

with CustomContextManager() as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
```

Slide 6: Results for: Creating Custom Context Managers

```
Entering the context
Inside the context
Exiting the context
```

Slide 7: Using contextlib.contextmanager

The 'contextlib.contextmanager' decorator provides a more concise way to create context managers using generator functions. This approach can be more readable for simple context managers.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def custom_context():
    print("Entering the context")
    yield
    print("Exiting the context")

with custom_context():
    print("Inside the context")
```

Slide 8: Results for: Using contextlib.contextmanager

```
Entering the context
Inside the context
Exiting the context
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Database Connection Management

Context managers are particularly useful for managing database connections. They ensure that connections are properly closed, even if an error occurs during execution.

```python
import sqlite3
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def db_connection(db_name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

with db_connection('example.db') as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)", ("Alice",))
    conn.commit()

# Connection is automatically closed after the 'with' block
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Temporary File Management

Context managers can be used to manage temporary files, ensuring they are properly created and deleted when no longer needed.

```python
import tempfile
import os

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+', delete=False) as temp_file:
    temp_file.write("This is a temporary file.")
    temp_file_path = temp_file.name

print(f"Temporary file created at: {temp_file_path}")

# File content can be read outside the context
with open(temp_file_path, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(f"File content: {content}")

# Clean up: remove the temporary file
os.unlink(temp_file_path)
print("Temporary file removed.")
```

Slide 11: Error Handling in Context Managers

Context managers can gracefully handle exceptions that occur within their scope. This feature is particularly useful for ensuring proper resource cleanup in case of errors.

```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Connecting to the database")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        if exc_type:
            print(f"An error occurred: {exc_value}")
        print("Closing the database connection")
        return True  # Suppress the exception

with DatabaseConnection() as db:
    print("Connected to the database")
    raise ValueError("Simulated error")

print("Execution continues after the context manager")
```

Slide 12: Results for: Error Handling in Context Managers

```
Connecting to the database
Connected to the database
An error occurred: Simulated error
Closing the database connection
Execution continues after the context manager
```

Slide 13: Nested Context Managers

Context managers can be nested to manage multiple resources simultaneously. This is particularly useful when working with complex systems that require multiple setup and teardown steps.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def outer_context():
    print("Entering outer context")
    yield "outer"
    print("Exiting outer context")

@contextmanager
def inner_context():
    print("Entering inner context")
    yield "inner"
    print("Exiting inner context")

with outer_context() as outer:
    print(f"In {outer} context")
    with inner_context() as inner:
        print(f"In {inner} context")
        print("Performing nested operations")
```

Slide 14: Results for: Nested Context Managers

```
Entering outer context
In outer context
Entering inner context
In inner context
Performing nested operations
Exiting inner context
Exiting outer context
```
