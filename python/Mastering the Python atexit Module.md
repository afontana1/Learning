## Mastering the Python atexit Module
Slide 1: The atexit Module in Python

The atexit module in Python provides a simple interface to register functions to be called when a program exits. This module is particularly useful for cleanup operations, closing files, or performing final actions before the Python interpreter shuts down.

```python
import atexit

def goodbye():
    print("Goodbye, world!")

atexit.register(goodbye)

print("Hello, world!")
# Output:
# Hello, world!
# Goodbye, world!
```

Slide 2: Basic Usage of atexit.register()

The atexit.register() function is the core of the atexit module. It allows you to register functions that will be called when the program exits normally (i.e., not when it crashes or is forcibly terminated).

```python
import atexit

def cleanup():
    print("Performing cleanup...")

atexit.register(cleanup)

# Your main program here
print("Main program running...")

# Output:
# Main program running...
# Performing cleanup...
```

Slide 3: Multiple Exit Functions

You can register multiple functions with atexit. They will be called in the reverse order of registration (last registered, first called).

```python
import atexit

def cleanup1():
    print("Cleanup 1")

def cleanup2():
    print("Cleanup 2")

atexit.register(cleanup1)
atexit.register(cleanup2)

print("Main program")

# Output:
# Main program
# Cleanup 2
# Cleanup 1
```

Slide 4: Unregistering Exit Functions

The atexit module also provides a way to unregister functions if you no longer want them to be called at exit.

```python
import atexit

def unnecessary_function():
    print("This won't be called")

atexit.register(unnecessary_function)
atexit.unregister(unnecessary_function)

print("Main program")

# Output:
# Main program
```

Slide 5: Passing Arguments to Exit Functions

You can pass arguments to your exit functions by using lambda functions or functools.partial.

```python
import atexit
from functools import partial

def goodbye(name):
    print(f"Goodbye, {name}!")

atexit.register(lambda: goodbye("Alice"))
atexit.register(partial(goodbye, "Bob"))

print("Hello, everyone!")

# Output:
# Hello, everyone!
# Goodbye, Bob!
# Goodbye, Alice!
```

Slide 6: Error Handling in Exit Functions

If an exit function raises an exception, it is printed to sys.stderr and the next exit function is called. The program will still exit after all registered functions are called.

```python
import atexit
import sys

def faulty_exit():
    raise Exception("Oops!")

def safe_exit():
    print("Safely exiting")

atexit.register(faulty_exit)
atexit.register(safe_exit)

print("Main program")

# Output:
# Main program
# Safely exiting
# Exception: Oops!
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: Closing Files

One common use of atexit is to ensure that files are properly closed when the program exits, even if an exception occurs.

```python
import atexit

log_file = open("app.log", "w")

def close_log_file():
    print("Closing log file...")
    log_file.close()

atexit.register(close_log_file)

# Your main program here
log_file.write("Application started\n")
print("Application running...")

# Output:
# Application running...
# Closing log file...
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Database Connection Cleanup

Another practical use of atexit is to ensure database connections are properly closed when the program exits.

```python
import atexit
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")

def close_db_connection():
    print("Closing database connection...")
    conn.close()

atexit.register(close_db_connection)

# Your main program here
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (name TEXT, age INTEGER)")
print("Database operations completed")

# Output:
# Database operations completed
# Closing database connection...
```

Slide 9: atexit with Context Managers

While atexit is useful, Python's context managers (using the 'with' statement) often provide a more elegant solution for resource management.

```python
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")
        return self.conn

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print("Closing database connection...")
        self.conn.close()

with DatabaseConnection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (name TEXT, age INTEGER)")
    print("Database operations completed")

# Output:
# Database operations completed
# Closing database connection...
```

Slide 10: atexit in Multiprocessing

When using multiprocessing, atexit functions are only called in the main process. Child processes need to handle their own cleanup.

```python
import atexit
import multiprocessing

def exit_function():
    print(f"Exiting process {multiprocessing.current_process().name}")

def worker():
    atexit.register(exit_function)
    print(f"Worker {multiprocessing.current_process().name} running")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    atexit.register(exit_function)
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)
    p.start()
    p.join()
    print("Main program exiting")

# Output:
# Worker Process-1 running
# Main program exiting
# Exiting process MainProcess
```

Slide 11: atexit vs signal Handling

While atexit is useful for normal program termination, it doesn't handle signals like SIGTERM. For more robust exit handling, combine atexit with signal handling.

```python
import atexit
import signal
import sys

def exit_function():
    print("Performing cleanup...")

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print(f"Received signal {sig}")
    sys.exit(0)

atexit.register(exit_function)
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)

print("Program running. Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
signal.pause()

# Output (when terminated with SIGTERM):
# Program running. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
# Received signal 15
# Performing cleanup...
```

Slide 12: Limitations of atexit

It's important to note that atexit functions are not called when the program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when os.\_exit() is called, or if Python crashes due to a fatal error.

```python
import atexit
import os

def exit_function():
    print("This won't be called")

atexit.register(exit_function)

print("About to exit abruptly...")
os._exit(0)

# Output:
# About to exit abruptly...
```

Slide 13: Best Practices with atexit

When using atexit, it's a good practice to keep exit functions simple, fast, and focused on cleanup tasks. Avoid complex operations that might fail or take a long time to complete.

```python
import atexit
import time

def quick_cleanup():
    print("Performing quick cleanup")

def slow_cleanup():
    print("Starting slow cleanup")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a slow operation
    print("Slow cleanup finished")

atexit.register(quick_cleanup)
atexit.register(slow_cleanup)

print("Main program running")

# Output:
# Main program running
# Starting slow cleanup
# Slow cleanup finished
# Performing quick cleanup
```
