## Optimizing Algorithms with Memoization
Slide 1: Understanding Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique that can significantly improve the performance of functions by caching their results. It's particularly useful for recursive functions or functions that perform expensive computations with repeated inputs. Let's explore how memoization works and its benefits.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Without memoization
import time

start = time.time()
print(fibonacci(30))
end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

```

Slide 3: Implementing Memoization Manually

We can implement memoization manually using a dictionary to store previously computed results. This approach significantly reduces the execution time for recursive functions like Fibonacci.

```python
def memoized_fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    result = memoized_fibonacci(n-1, memo) + memoized_fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

start = time.time()
print(memoized_fibonacci(30))
end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Time taken: 0.00 seconds
```

Slide 5: Using functools.lru\_cache

Python's functools module provides a decorator called lru\_cache, which implements memoization automatically. This decorator uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy to store function results.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def lru_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return lru_fibonacci(n-1) + lru_fibonacci(n-2)

start = time.time()
print(lru_fibonacci(30))
end = time.time()
print(f"Time taken: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Time taken: 0.00 seconds
```

Slide 7: Time Complexity Analysis

Let's analyze the time complexity of the Fibonacci function with and without memoization. We'll use a simple timing function to measure execution time for different input sizes.

```python
def time_function(func, n):
    start = time.time()
    func(n)
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

# Test for different input sizes
sizes = [10, 20, 30, 35]
for size in sizes:
    print(f"n = {size}")
    print(f"Without memoization: {time_function(fibonacci, size):.4f} seconds")
    print(f"With memoization: {time_function(memoized_fibonacci, size):.4f} seconds")
    print(f"With lru_cache: {time_function(lru_fibonacci, size):.4f} seconds")
    print()
```

n = 35
Without memoization: 2.7735 seconds
With memoization: 0.0000 seconds
With lru_cache: 0.0000 seconds
```

Slide 9: Memoization in Real-Life: Image Processing

Memoization can be useful in image processing tasks, such as applying filters to images. Let's simulate a computationally expensive image filter and see how memoization improves performance.

```python
import random

def expensive_filter(pixel_value, intensity):
    # Simulate a complex calculation
    result = 0
    for _ in range(1000000):
        result += (pixel_value * intensity) % 256
    return result % 256

def apply_filter(image, intensity):
    return [[expensive_filter(pixel, intensity) for pixel in row] for row in image]

def memoized_apply_filter(image, intensity, memo={}):
    def memoized_filter(pixel, intensity):
        key = (pixel, intensity)
        if key not in memo:
            memo[key] = expensive_filter(pixel, intensity)
        return memo[key]
    
    return [[memoized_filter(pixel, intensity) for pixel in row] for row in image]

# Create a sample image (50x50 pixels)
image = [[random.randint(0, 255) for _ in range(50)] for _ in range(50)]

start = time.time()
filtered_image = apply_filter(image, 0.5)
end = time.time()
print(f"Without memoization: {end - start:.2f} seconds")

start = time.time()
memoized_filtered_image = memoized_apply_filter(image, 0.5)
end = time.time()
print(f"With memoization: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 11: Memoization in Real-Life: Website Caching

Memoization can be applied to improve website performance by caching frequently accessed data. Let's simulate a web server that fetches user profiles.

```python
import time
import random

def fetch_user_profile(user_id):
    # Simulate a database query
    time.sleep(1)
    return f"User {user_id}: {random.randint(1000, 9999)}"

def memoized_fetch_user_profile(user_id, cache={}):
    if user_id not in cache:
        cache[user_id] = fetch_user_profile(user_id)
    return cache[user_id]

# Simulate multiple requests for the same user
user_ids = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]

start = time.time()
for user_id in user_ids:
    print(fetch_user_profile(user_id))
end = time.time()
print(f"Without memoization: {end - start:.2f} seconds")

start = time.time()
for user_id in user_ids:
    print(memoized_fetch_user_profile(user_id))
end = time.time()
print(f"With memoization: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

User 1: 5678
User 3: 3456
User 2: 1234

With memoization: 3.01 seconds
```

Slide 13: Limitations and Considerations

While memoization can provide significant performance improvements, it's important to consider its limitations and potential drawbacks:

1.  Memory usage: Memoization trades memory for speed. For functions with many possible inputs, the cache can grow large and consume significant memory.
2.  Cache invalidation: If the function's output depends on external factors that change over time, cached results may become stale and need to be invalidated.
3.  Non-deterministic functions: Memoization assumes that a function always returns the same output for a given input. It's not suitable for functions with side effects or those depending on external state.
4.  Overhead: For simple functions or those rarely called with the same inputs, the overhead of maintaining a cache might outweigh the performance benefits.

```python
# Example of a function not suitable for memoization
import random

def generate_random_number(seed):
    random.seed(seed)
    return random.randint(1, 100)

# This won't work as expected with memoization
memoized_generate_random_number = lru_cache(maxsize=None)(generate_random_number)

print(generate_random_number(42))
print(generate_random_number(42))
print(memoized_generate_random_number(42))
print(memoized_generate_random_number(42))
```
