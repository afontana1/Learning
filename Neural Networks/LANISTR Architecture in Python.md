## LANISTR Architecture in Python
Slide 1: 

Introduction to LANISTR Architecture

LANISTR (LANguage INSTance Representation) is a neural network architecture designed for natural language processing tasks. It is based on the Transformer model and incorporates specialized components for handling language instances, such as words, phrases, or sentences. The architecture aims to capture the contextual information and relationships within language instances to improve performance on various NLP tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class LANISTR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len):
        super(LANISTR, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, hidden_size)
        self.encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(hidden_size, num_heads, dim_feedforward=2048),
            num_layers
        )
        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(hidden_size, max_len)

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        embeddings = self.embedding(input_ids) * math.sqrt(self.embedding.embedding_dim)
        embeddings = self.positional_encoding(embeddings)
        encoder_output = self.encoder(embeddings)
        return encoder_output
```

Slide 2: 

Embedding Layer

The LANISTR architecture starts with an embedding layer that converts the input language instances (e.g., words or tokens) into dense vector representations. This allows the model to capture the semantic and syntactic information of each instance, which is crucial for understanding the context and relationships within the input sequence.

```python
class LANISTR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len):
        super(LANISTR, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, hidden_size)
        # ...

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        embeddings = self.embedding(input_ids) * math.sqrt(self.embedding.embedding_dim)
        # ...
        return encoder_output
```

Slide 3: 

Positional Encoding

Since the Transformer model does not have an inherent notion of word order, LANISTR incorporates positional encoding to inject information about the position of each instance within the sequence. This helps the model understand the relative positions of instances and capture their contextual relationships.

```python
class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000):
        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()
        pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)
        position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0)
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)

    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.pe[:, :x.size(1)]
```

Slide 4: 

Transformer Encoder

The core of the LANISTR architecture is the Transformer Encoder, which consists of multiple encoder layers. Each encoder layer applies multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between instances within the input sequence. This allows the model to understand the context and dependencies between different parts of the input.

```python
class LANISTR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len):
        super(LANISTR, self).__init__()
        # ...
        self.encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(hidden_size, num_heads, dim_feedforward=2048),
            num_layers
        )
        # ...

    def forward(self, input_ids):
        # ...
        embeddings = self.positional_encoding(embeddings)
        encoder_output = self.encoder(embeddings)
        return encoder_output
```

Slide 5: 

Multi-Head Attention

The multi-head attention mechanism is a crucial component of the Transformer Encoder layers in LANISTR. It allows the model to attend to different representations of the input instances simultaneously, capturing diverse contextual information and dependencies from different perspectives.

```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads):
        super(MultiHeadAttention, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.head_dim = hidden_size // num_heads
        self.queries = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.keys = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.values = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.final_linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)

    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, mask=None):
        # Implement multi-head attention mechanism
        # ...
        return output
```

Slide 6: 

Feed-Forward Networks

In addition to the multi-head attention mechanism, each encoder layer in LANISTR incorporates feed-forward networks. These networks apply non-linear transformations to the input instances, allowing the model to capture more complex relationships and patterns within the input sequence.

```python
class FeedForwardNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, dim_feedforward):
        super(FeedForwardNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, dim_feedforward)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(dim_feedforward, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x
```

Slide 7: 

Residual Connections and Layer Normalization

To improve the training stability and performance of the LANISTR architecture, residual connections and layer normalization are employed. Residual connections allow the model to learn residual mappings, which can help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. Layer normalization helps to stabilize the activations of the model during training.

```python
class ResidualConnection(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(ResidualConnection, self).__init__()
        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)

    def forward(self, x, residual):
        return self.layer_norm(x + residual)
```

Slide 8: 

Task-Specific Output Layer

Depending on the specific NLP task, LANISTR can incorporate different output layers to produce the desired output format. For example, for text classification tasks, a linear layer followed by a softmax activation can be used to generate class probabilities. For sequence-to-sequence tasks, a decoder module can be added to generate output sequences.

```python
class ClassificationHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(ClassificationHead, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, encoder_output):
        logits = self.linear(encoder_output[:, 0, :])
        return logits
```

Slide 9: 

Pre-training and Fine-tuning

Like many other language models, LANISTR can be pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using self-supervised objectives, such as masked language modeling or next sentence prediction. This pre-training process helps the model capture general language patterns and knowledge. Subsequently, the pre-trained LANISTR model can be fine-tuned on specific task-related datasets to adapt to the target task.

```python
# Pre-training example
model = LANISTR(vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        inputs, targets = batch
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Fine-tuning example
task_dataset = TaskDataset(...)
task_dataloader = DataLoader(task_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

pretrained_model = LANISTR(vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len)
pretrained_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('pretrained_model.pth'))

task_head = ClassificationHead(hidden_size, num_classes)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in task_dataloader:
        inputs, targets = batch
        outputs = pretrained_model(inputs)
        logits = task_head(outputs)
        loss = criterion(logits, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

Slide 10: 

Attention Visualization

One of the advantages of the LANISTR architecture is the interpretability provided by the attention mechanisms. The attention weights learned by the multi-head attention layers can be visualized to understand how the model attends to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. This can provide insights into the model's decision-making process and help identify potential biases or errors.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_attention(input_text, attention_weights):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    ax.imshow(attention_weights, cmap='Blues')
    ax.set_xticks(range(len(input_text.split())))
    ax.set_xticklabels(input_text.split(), rotation=90, fontsize=12)
    ax.set_yticks(range(attention_weights.shape[0]))
    ax.set_yticklabels([f"Head {i}" for i in range(attention_weights.shape[0])])
    ax.set_xlabel("Input Text", fontsize=14)
    ax.set_ylabel("Attention Heads", fontsize=14)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

Slide 11: 

Handling Long Sequences

For some NLP tasks, the input sequences can be extremely long, making it computationally expensive or even infeasible to process them in their entirety. To handle such cases, LANISTR can employ techniques like sliding windows or hierarchical attention mechanisms. These techniques allow the model to process the input in smaller chunks or at multiple levels of abstraction, reducing the computational overhead while maintaining performance.

```python
class SlidingWindowAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads, window_size):
        super(SlidingWindowAttention, self).__init__()
        self.attention = MultiHeadAttention(hidden_size, num_heads)
        self.window_size = window_size

    def forward(self, inputs):
        outputs = []
        for i in range(0, inputs.size(1), self.window_size):
            window = inputs[:, i:i+self.window_size]
            output = self.attention(window, window, window)
            outputs.append(output)
        return torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)
```

Slide 12: 

Efficient Transformer Architectures

While the LANISTR architecture provides powerful language modeling capabilities, it can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale applications. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various efficient Transformer architectures, such as Reformers, Linformers, and Longformers. These architectures employ techniques like locality-sensitive hashing, linear attention, or sparse attention to reduce the computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism, making it more scalable and efficient.

```python
class EfficientTransformerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads, num_layers, efficient_attention):
        super(EfficientTransformerEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
                hidden_size,
                num_heads,
                dim_feedforward=2048,
                attention_module=efficient_attention
            )
            for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])

    def forward(self, inputs):
        output = inputs
        for layer in self.layers:
            output = layer(output)
        return output
```

Slide 13: 

Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation

LANISTR models pre-trained on general-purpose corpora can be further adapted to specific domains or tasks through transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. This can involve fine-tuning the pre-trained model on domain-specific data or incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the model's architecture or objective functions. These techniques can improve the model's performance on domain-specific tasks while leveraging the knowledge gained from pre-training.

```python
# Domain adaptation example
domain_dataset = DomainDataset(...)
domain_dataloader = DataLoader(domain_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

pretrained_model = LANISTR(vocab_size, hidden_size, num_layers, num_heads, max_len)
pretrained_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('pretrained_model.pth'))

domain_head = DomainClassificationHead(hidden_size, num_domain_classes)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in domain_dataloader:
        inputs, domain_targets = batch
        outputs = pretrained_model(inputs)
        logits = domain_head(outputs)
        loss = criterion(logits, domain_targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```
