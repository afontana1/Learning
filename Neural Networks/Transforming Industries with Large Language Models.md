## Transforming Industries with Large Language Models

Slide 1: Introduction to LLM Evaluation

Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their performance and capabilities. As LLMs become more prevalent in various industries, it's essential to have robust methods for assessing their outputs. This presentation will cover different evaluation techniques, including automated metrics, human evaluation, and emerging frameworks.

```python
import transformers
import torch

def load_model(model_name):
    model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return model, tokenizer

model, tokenizer = load_model("gpt2")
print(f"Model loaded: {model.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Tokenizer loaded: {tokenizer.__class__.__name__}")
```

Slide 2: Automated Metrics - BERT Score

BERT Score is a popular metric for evaluating text generation quality. It measures semantic similarity between generated and reference text using embeddings from pre-trained models like BERT.

```python
from bert_score import score

def calculate_bert_score(candidate, reference):
    P, R, F1 = score([candidate], [reference], lang="en", verbose=True)
    return {"Precision": P.item(), "Recall": R.item(), "F1": F1.item()}

candidate = "The cat sat on the mat."
reference = "A feline rested on the floor covering."

result = calculate_bert_score(candidate, reference)
print("BERT Score:", result)
```

Slide 3: Automated Metrics - BLEU Score

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Score is commonly used for evaluating translation quality. It compares the overlap of n-grams between generated and reference translations.

```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu

def calculate_bleu_score(candidate, reference):
    return sentence_bleu([reference.split()], candidate.split())

candidate = "The cat is on the mat."
reference = "There is a cat on the mat."

bleu_score = calculate_bleu_score(candidate, reference)
print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.4f}")
```

Slide 4: Automated Metrics - ROUGE Score

ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) Score is used to assess summarization quality by comparing the overlap of n-grams between generated and reference summaries.

```python
from rouge import Rouge

def calculate_rouge_score(candidate, reference):
    rouge = Rouge()
    scores = rouge.get_scores(candidate, reference)
    return scores[0]

candidate = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
reference = "A fast auburn canine leaps above an idle hound."

rouge_scores = calculate_rouge_score(candidate, reference)
print("ROUGE Scores:", rouge_scores)
```

Slide 5: Automated Metrics - Classification Metrics

For text classification tasks, metrics like Precision, Recall, and Accuracy are crucial. These metrics help evaluate the performance of LLMs in categorizing text into predefined classes.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support, accuracy_score

def classification_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
    precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    return {"Precision": precision, "Recall": recall, "F1": f1, "Accuracy": accuracy}

y_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
y_pred = [0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1]

metrics = classification_metrics(y_true, y_pred)
print("Classification Metrics:", metrics)
```

Slide 6: Human Evaluation

Human evaluation involves reviewers assessing the LLM's output based on predefined criteria. This method can provide nuanced insights that automated metrics might miss.

```python
import random

def simulate_human_evaluation(generated_text, num_evaluators=3):
    criteria = ["Coherence", "Relevance", "Fluency"]
    results = {}
    
    for criterion in criteria:
        scores = [random.randint(1, 5) for _ in range(num_evaluators)]
        results[criterion] = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    
    return results

generated_text = "AI has revolutionized various industries, improving efficiency and innovation."
evaluation_results = simulate_human_evaluation(generated_text)
print("Human Evaluation Results:", evaluation_results)
```

Slide 7: Model-to-Model Evaluation

Model-to-Model (M2M) evaluation uses one LLM to assess the output of another. This approach can provide more nuanced assessments by comparing outputs for logical consistency and relevance.

```python
import openai

def m2m_evaluation(generated_text, evaluation_prompt):
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant evaluating the quality of text."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Evaluate the following text:\n{generated_text}\n\n{evaluation_prompt}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content']

generated_text = "The Earth orbits around the Sun in an elliptical path."
evaluation_prompt = "Rate the scientific accuracy of this statement on a scale of 1-10 and explain your rating."

evaluation_result = m2m_evaluation(generated_text, evaluation_prompt)
print("M2M Evaluation Result:", evaluation_result)
```

Slide 8: G-Eval Framework

G-Eval is a novel approach that uses advanced LLMs like GPT-4 to evaluate other LLM outputs. It provides scores based on criteria such as coherence and contextual accuracy.

```python
def g_eval(generated_text, criteria):
    # Simulating G-Eval using a hypothetical API
    import random
    
    scores = {}
    for criterion in criteria:
        scores[criterion] = random.uniform(0, 1)
    
    return scores

generated_text = "Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in data to make predictions."
criteria = ["Coherence", "Factual Accuracy", "Relevance"]

g_eval_scores = g_eval(generated_text, criteria)
print("G-Eval Scores:", g_eval_scores)
```

Slide 9: Challenges in LLM Evaluation

Evaluating LLMs presents inherent challenges due to the subjective nature of language and the probabilistic behavior of these models. It's important to consider these limitations when interpreting evaluation results.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

challenges = [
    "Subjectivity",
    "Context Dependency",
    "Lack of Ground Truth",
    "Model Bias",
    "Task Specificity"
]

impact_scores = [0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.75]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(challenges, impact_scores)
plt.title("Impact of Challenges in LLM Evaluation")
plt.xlabel("Challenges")
plt.ylabel("Impact Score")
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: Choosing the Right Evaluation Method

The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific use case and available resources. This slide discusses factors to consider when selecting an evaluation approach.

```python
def recommend_evaluation_method(task_type, supervised_data_available, resource_level):
    if supervised_data_available:
        if task_type == "classification":
            return "Use classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1)"
        elif task_type == "generation":
            return "Use automated metrics like BLEU or ROUGE"
    else:
        if resource_level == "high":
            return "Consider human evaluation or M2M evaluation"
        else:
            return "Use G-Eval or other lightweight automated metrics"

task_type = "generation"
supervised_data_available = False
resource_level = "medium"

recommendation = recommend_evaluation_method(task_type, supervised_data_available, resource_level)
print("Recommended Evaluation Method:", recommendation)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Chatbot Evaluation

In this example, we'll evaluate a simple chatbot using multiple metrics to demonstrate a comprehensive evaluation approach.

```python
import random

def simple_chatbot(input_text):
    responses = [
        "That's interesting! Tell me more.",
        "I see. How does that make you feel?",
        "Can you elaborate on that?",
        "That's a great point. What else do you think about it?"
    ]
    return random.choice(responses)

def evaluate_chatbot():
    inputs = [
        "I love programming in Python.",
        "The weather is beautiful today.",
        "I'm feeling a bit stressed about work."
    ]
    
    total_relevance = 0
    total_coherence = 0
    
    for input_text in inputs:
        response = simple_chatbot(input_text)
        print(f"Input: {input_text}")
        print(f"Response: {response}")
        
        # Simulating human evaluation
        relevance = random.uniform(0, 1)
        coherence = random.uniform(0, 1)
        
        total_relevance += relevance
        total_coherence += coherence
        
        print(f"Relevance: {relevance:.2f}, Coherence: {coherence:.2f}\n")
    
    avg_relevance = total_relevance / len(inputs)
    avg_coherence = total_coherence / len(inputs)
    
    print(f"Average Relevance: {avg_relevance:.2f}")
    print(f"Average Coherence: {avg_coherence:.2f}")

evaluate_chatbot()
```

Slide 12: Real-Life Example: Sentiment Analysis Evaluation

This example demonstrates how to evaluate a sentiment analysis model using classification metrics.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Sample dataset
texts = [
    "I love this product!",
    "This is terrible.",
    "Not bad, but could be better.",
    "Absolutely amazing experience!",
    "Worst purchase ever."
]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Create a simple bag-of-words model
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Train a Naive Bayes classifier
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X, labels)

# Make predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X)

# Evaluate the model
report = classification_report(labels, predictions, target_names=['Negative', 'Positive'])
print("Sentiment Analysis Model Evaluation:")
print(report)
```
