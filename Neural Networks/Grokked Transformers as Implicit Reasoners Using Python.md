## Grokked Transformers as Implicit Reasoners Using Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Grokked Transformers as Implicit Reasoners

Grokked Transformers are a novel approach to endowing large language models with reasoning capabilities. Unlike traditional methods that explicitly encode rules or knowledge, Grokked Transformers aim to implicitly learn reasoning patterns from data, leveraging the power of transformers to capture complex relationships and dependencies.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Define input text
input_text = "The quick brown fox"

# Tokenize input and generate output
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, do_sample=True)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_text)
```

Slide 2: Transformer Architecture Recap

Before diving into Grokked Transformers, let's recap the transformer architecture, which forms the foundation for many state-of-the-art language models. Transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in sequences, making them well-suited for tasks like machine translation and language generation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerEncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, nhead, dim_feedforward, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, nhead, dropout=dropout)
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, dim_feedforward)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(dim_feedforward, d_model)

    def forward(self, src, src_mask=None, src_key_padding_mask=None):
        src2, _ = self.self_attn(src, src, src, attn_mask=src_mask,
                                 key_padding_mask=src_key_padding_mask)
        src = src + self.dropout(src2)
        src2 = self.linear2(self.dropout(F.relu(self.linear1(src))))
        src = src + self.dropout(src2)
        return src
```

Slide 3: The Reasoning Challenge

While transformers excel at capturing patterns and generating coherent text, endowing them with true reasoning capabilities remains a significant challenge. Reasoning requires the ability to follow logical rules, draw inferences, and combine multiple pieces of information in a systematic and consistent manner.

```python
# Example of a reasoning task
premise1 = "All birds can fly."
premise2 = "Tweety is a bird."
conclusion = "Therefore, Tweety can fly."

# Traditional approach: Explicitly encode rules and reasoning steps
# 1. Parse premises and conclusion into logical forms
# 2. Apply inference rules (e.g., modus ponens)
# 3. Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises

# Grokked Transformers aim to implicitly learn reasoning patterns from data
```

Slide 4: Grokked Transformers: The Idea

The core idea behind Grokked Transformers is to leverage the power of transformers to implicitly learn reasoning patterns from data, without explicitly encoding rules or knowledge. By fine-tuning on carefully curated datasets containing reasoning tasks, the model can potentially "grok" (deeply understand) the underlying reasoning principles.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")

# Define input text with reasoning task
input_text = "Premise 1: All birds can fly. Premise 2: Tweety is a bird. Question: Can Tweety fly?"

# Tokenize input and generate output
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, do_sample=True)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_text)
```

Slide 5: Dataset Creation

Creating high-quality datasets for fine-tuning Grokked Transformers is a crucial step. These datasets should capture a diverse range of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-step inference problems. Careful curation and quality control are essential to ensure the model learns meaningful patterns.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load reasoning dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv("reasoning_dataset.csv")

# Example reasoning task
premises = dataset["premises"][0]
question = dataset["question"][0]
answer = dataset["answer"][0]

print("Premises:", premises)
print("Question:", question)
print("Answer:", answer)
```

Slide 6: Fine-tuning Grokked Transformers

Once a suitable dataset is prepared, Grokked Transformers can be fine-tuned on the reasoning tasks using standard language modeling objectives. The model is trained to generate the correct answer or conclusion given the premises and question as input.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Prepare data for fine-tuning
dataset = load_reasoning_dataset()
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="grokked-transformer", num_train_epochs=5)

# Instantiate trainer and fine-tune the model
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["val"],
)
trainer.train()
```

Slide 7: Evaluating Grokked Transformers

Evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Grokked Transformers is crucial to assess their performance and potential. This can be done by testing the fine-tuned model on held-out reasoning tasks and measuring metrics such as accuracy, consistency, and generalization to new reasoning types.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")

# Create a pipeline for text generation
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Example reasoning task
premises = "All birds can fly. Tweety is a bird."
question = "Can Tweety fly?"

# Generate answer
output = generator(premises + " Question: " + question, max_length=100)
answer = output[0]["generated_text"]

print("Answer:", answer)
```

Slide 8: Challenges and Limitations

While Grokked Transformers hold promise, there are several challenges and limitations to consider. Ensuring consistent and robust reasoning across diverse tasks can be difficult. Additionally, the lack of explicit knowledge representation may limit the model's ability to handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.

```python
# Example of a challenging multi-step reasoning task
premises = [
    "All birds have wings.",
    "Penguins are birds.",
    "Penguins cannot fly.",
    "Tweety is a bird.",
    "Tweety can fly."
]
question = "Is Tweety a penguin?"

# Generating a correct answer may be challenging for Grokked Transformers
# due to the need to combine multiple premises and handle exceptions.
```

Slide 9: Grokked Transformers in Practice

Despite the challenges, Grokked Transformers have shown promising results in various real-world applications, such as question answering, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference. These models have been successfully employed in scenarios where reasoning capabilities are required, leveraging their ability to implicitly learn patterns and generalize to unseen tasks.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load fine-tuned Grokked Transformer model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")

# Create a pipeline for text generation
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Example commonsense reasoning task
context = "John went to the park on a sunny day. He brought a baseball bat and a mitt."
question = "What activity was John likely planning to do at the park?"

# Generate answer
output = generator(context + " Question: " + question, max_length=100)
answer = output[0]["generated_text"]

print("Answer:", answer)
```

Slide 10: Combining Grokked Transformers with External Knowledge

While Grokked Transformers aim to learn reasoning patterns implicitly, incorporating external knowledge sources can further enhance their capabilities. Techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and memory modules allow the model to access and leverage external knowledge bases or memory buffers during reasoning tasks.

```python
from transformers import RetrieverReader, RetrieverReaderTokenizer

# Load pre-trained retriever reader model and tokenizer
tokenizer = RetrieverReaderTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/dpr-reader-single-nq-base")
model = RetrieverReader.from_pretrained("facebook/dpr-reader-single-nq-base")

# Define context and query
context = "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower."
query = "Where is the Eiffel Tower located?"

# Retrieve relevant passages and generate answer
retriever = model.retriever(query, tokenizer=tokenizer)
answer = model.reader(input_ids=retriever["ids"], tokenizer=tokenizer)

print("Answer:", answer)
```

Slide 11: Interpretability and Explainability

One challenge with Grokked Transformers is their lack of interpretability and explainability. As reasoning patterns are implicitly learned, it can be difficult to understand the model's decision-making process and the reasoning steps it follows. Researchers are exploring techniques to improve interpretability, such as attention visualization and model distillation.

```python
import captum

# Load pre-trained Grokked Transformer model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")

# Define input text
input_text = "Premise 1: All birds can fly. Premise 2: Tweety is a bird. Question: Can Tweety fly?"

# Tokenize input
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Compute integrated gradients
ig = captum.attr.IntegratedGradients(model)
attributions, delta = ig.attribute(input_ids, target=0, return_convergence_delta=True)

# Visualize attributions
tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[0])
for token, attr in zip(tokens, attributions[0]):
    print(f"{token}: {attr}")
```

Slide 12: Future Directions and Open Questions

While Grokked Transformers have made significant strides, several open questions and future research directions remain:

* Improving consistency and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks
* Handling complex, multi-step reasoning problems
* Incorporating external knowledge and memory efficiently
* Enhancing interpretability and explainability
* Exploring alternative architectures and training objectives

```python
# Example of a future research direction: Exploring alternative architectures
# and training objectives for improved reasoning capabilities

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ReasoningTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, reasoning_module):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder
        self.reasoning_module = reasoning_module

    def forward(self, input_ids, reasoning_steps):
        encoded = self.encoder(input_ids)
        reasoned = self.reasoning_module(encoded, reasoning_steps)
        output = self.decoder(reasoned)
        return output
```

Slide 13: Grokked Transformers: A Promising Step Towards Reasoning

Grokked Transformers represent a promising step towards endowing large language models with reasoning capabilities. By leveraging the power of transformers to implicitly learn reasoning patterns from data, these models have shown potential in tackling a wide range of reasoning tasks. However, challenges remain, and continued research is necessary to address limitations and unlock the full potential of Grokked Transformers.

```python
# Example of using a Grokked Transformer for a reasoning task
from transformers import pipeline

# Load fine-tuned Grokked Transformer model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("grokked-transformer")

# Create a pipeline for text generation
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

# Example reasoning task
premises = "All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Penguins cannot fly. Tweety is a bird."
question = "Can Tweety fly?"

# Generate answer
output = generator(premises + " Question: " + question, max_length=100)
answer = output[0]["generated_text"]

print("Answer:", answer)
```
