## Understanding Embeddings and Sentence Transformers in NLP
Slide 1: Introduction to Embeddings

Embeddings are dense vector representations of words, sentences, or documents in a continuous vector space. They capture semantic meaning and relationships between linguistic elements, enabling machines to understand and process natural language more effectively.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example word embeddings
word_embeddings = {
    "king": np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]),
    "queen": np.array([0.15, 0.25, 0.35]),
    "man": np.array([0.05, 0.1, 0.15]),
    "woman": np.array([0.08, 0.13, 0.18])
}

# Visualize embeddings using t-SNE
embeddings = np.array(list(word_embeddings.values()))
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
embeddings_2d = tsne.fit_transform(embeddings)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
for i, (word, _) in enumerate(word_embeddings.items()):
    x, y = embeddings_2d[i]
    plt.scatter(x, y)
    plt.annotate(word, (x, y), xytext=(5, 5), textcoords='offset points')

plt.title("Word Embeddings Visualization")
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Word Embeddings: The Foundation

Word embeddings are the building blocks of modern NLP. They represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, where semantically similar words are closer together. This allows machines to capture relationships between words and perform various NLP tasks more effectively.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Sample sentences
sentences = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step",
    "Actions speak louder than words"
]

# Tokenize sentences
tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(sentence.lower()) for sentence in sentences]

# Train Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

# Get vector for a word
print("Vector for 'quick':", model.wv['quick'])

# Find similar words
print("Words similar to 'journey':", model.wv.most_similar('journey', topn=3))
```

Slide 3: Sentence Embeddings: Beyond Words

Sentence embeddings extend the concept of word embeddings to entire sentences. They capture the meaning of complete sentences, allowing for more nuanced understanding and comparison of text at a higher level. Sentence embeddings are crucial for tasks like semantic similarity, text classification, and information retrieval.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Initialize the SentenceTransformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Sample sentences
sentences = [
    "I love programming in Python",
    "Python is my favorite programming language",
    "Natural language processing is fascinating"
]

# Generate sentence embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

# Print the shape of the embeddings
print("Shape of embeddings:", embeddings.shape)

# Calculate cosine similarity between sentences
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)
print("Similarity matrix:")
print(similarity_matrix)
```

Slide 4: Transformer Architecture: The Game Changer

Transformers revolutionized NLP by introducing the self-attention mechanism, allowing models to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. This architecture forms the basis for powerful models like BERT, GPT, and T5, which have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_dim, 4 * embed_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(4 * embed_dim, embed_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        attention_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = self.norm1(x + attention_output)
        feed_forward_output = self.feed_forward(x)
        x = self.norm2(x + feed_forward_output)
        return x

# Example usage
embed_dim = 512
num_heads = 8
seq_length = 10
batch_size = 2

transformer = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads)
input_tensor = torch.randn(seq_length, batch_size, embed_dim)
output = transformer(input_tensor)

print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

Slide 5: BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

BERT, introduced by Google, is a powerful pre-trained language model that uses bidirectional training to understand context from both left and right sides of a word. It has significantly improved performance on various NLP tasks and serves as a foundation for many downstream applications.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Prepare input
text = "Understanding BERT is crucial for modern NLP."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the embeddings of the last layer
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

print("Shape of last hidden states:", last_hidden_states.shape)
print("Embedding of the first token:", last_hidden_states[0][0])
```

Slide 6: Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models

Fine-tuning allows us to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains. This transfer learning approach significantly reduces the amount of data and computational resources needed to achieve high performance on various NLP tasks.

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, AdamW
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch

# Assuming we have a binary classification task
texts = ["I love this product!", "This is terrible.", "Amazing experience!", "Worst purchase ever."]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize inputs
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")

# Prepare dataset
dataset = TensorDataset(inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask'], torch.tensor(labels))
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2)

# Load pre-trained model for sequence classification
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Set up optimizer
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# Fine-tuning loop
model.train()
for epoch in range(3):
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(input_ids=batch[0], attention_mask=batch[1], labels=batch[2])
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed")

print("Fine-tuning completed")
```

Slide 7: Sentence Similarity with Transformers

Sentence similarity is a fundamental task in NLP, used in applications like semantic search, question answering, and text clustering. Transformer-based models excel at capturing semantic similarity between sentences.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

# Load pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Sample sentences
sentences = [
    "The cat is sleeping on the couch",
    "A feline is resting on the sofa",
    "Dogs are playing in the park",
    "The couch is occupied by a sleeping cat"
]

# Compute embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

# Compute cosine similarity between all pairs of sentences
cosine_scores = util.pytorch_cos_sim(embeddings, embeddings)

# Print similarity scores
for i in range(len(sentences)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(sentences)):
        print(f"Similarity between \"{sentences[i]}\" and \"{sentences[j]}\": {cosine_scores[i][j].item():.4f}")
```

Slide 8: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Transformers

Named Entity Recognition is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text. Transformer-based models have significantly improved the accuracy of NER systems.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained NER pipeline
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english")

# Sample text
text = "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, announced a new project in Berlin last week."

# Perform NER
results = ner_pipeline(text)

# Process and print results
entities = {}
for result in results:
    if result['entity'] not in entities:
        entities[result['entity']] = []
    entities[result['entity']].append(result['word'])

for entity, words in entities.items():
    print(f"{entity}: {', '.join(words)}")
```

Slide 9: Text Classification with Transformers

Text classification is a common NLP task used in sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and spam detection. Transformer-based models have set new benchmarks in text classification tasks across various domains.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained text classification pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Sample texts
texts = [
    "I absolutely loved the movie! The acting was superb.",
    "The service at this restaurant was terrible. I'll never go back.",
    "The product works as expected. Nothing extraordinary.",
    "This book changed my life. I highly recommend it to everyone!"
]

# Perform sentiment analysis
for text in texts:
    result = classifier(text)[0]
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```

Slide 10: Question Answering with Transformers

Question Answering (QA) systems can automatically answer questions posed in natural language. Transformer-based models have dramatically improved the performance of QA systems, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained question-answering pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

# Context and question
context = """
The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially
criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it
has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
"""

question = "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"

# Perform question answering
result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['score']:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Text Summarization with Transformers

Text summarization is the task of creating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text while preserving its key information. Transformer-based models have shown remarkable ability in both extractive and abstractive summarization tasks.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Sample long text
long_text = """
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, 
objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a 
network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT allows objects to be sensed 
or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration 
of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit 
in addition to reduced human intervention. When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes 
an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, 
virtual power plants, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through 
its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure.
"""

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer(long_text, max_length=100, min_length=30, do_sample=False)

print("Original text length:", len(long_text))
print("Summary:", summary[0]['summary_text'])
print("Summary length:", len(summary[0]['summary_text']))
```

Slide 12: Real-life Example: Chatbot with Intent Classification

Chatbots are widely used in customer service, information retrieval, and personal assistants. Here's an example of how to create a simple chatbot using transformer-based intent classification.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained text classification pipeline
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")

# Define intents and their corresponding responses
intents = {
    "greeting": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "farewell": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
    "help": "I'm here to help. What do you need assistance with?",
    "product_info": "We offer a wide range of products. Could you specify which product you're interested in?",
    "other": "I'm not sure I understand. Could you please rephrase your question?"
}

# Function to classify user input and generate response
def get_bot_response(user_input):
    # Classify the intent
    results = classifier(user_input, candidate_labels=list(intents.keys()))
    predicted_intent = results[0]['label']
    
    # Get the corresponding response
    return intents.get(predicted_intent, intents["other"])

# Simulate a conversation
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == "quit":
        print("Bot: Goodbye!")
        break
    response = get_bot_response(user_input)
    print("Bot:", response)
```

Slide 13: Real-life Example: Content-Based Recommendation System

Content-based recommendation systems suggest items to users based on the characteristics of items they have liked in the past. Here's an example using sentence embeddings to build a simple movie recommendation system.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np

# Sample movie data: (title, description)
movies = [
    ("The Matrix", "A computer programmer discovers a dystopian world ruled by machines."),
    ("Inception", "A thief enters people's dreams to steal their secrets."),
    ("Interstellar", "Astronauts travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity."),
    ("The Terminator", "A cyborg assassin is sent back in time to kill a woman whose unborn son is key to humanity's future."),
    ("Blade Runner", "A blade runner must pursue and terminate four replicants who have returned to Earth seeking their creator.")
]

# Load pre-trained SentenceTransformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Compute embeddings for movie descriptions
movie_embeddings = model.encode([movie[1] for movie in movies])

# Function to get movie recommendations
def get_recommendations(liked_movie_index, top_n=2):
    liked_movie_embedding = movie_embeddings[liked_movie_index]
    similarities = np.dot(movie_embeddings, liked_movie_embedding)
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][1:top_n+1]
    return [movies[i][0] for i in top_indices]

# Example usage
liked_movie_index = 0  # The Matrix
recommendations = get_recommendations(liked_movie_index)
print(f"If you liked '{movies[liked_movie_index][0]}', you might also enjoy:")
for movie in recommendations:
    print(f"- {movie}")
```

Slide 14: Challenges and Limitations of Embeddings and Transformers

While embeddings and transformers have revolutionized NLP, they face several challenges:

Computational Complexity: Transformer models, especially large ones, require significant computational resources for training and inference, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments.

Data Bias: Embeddings can inherit and amplify biases present in the training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in downstream applications.

Contextual Understanding: Despite their power, current models still struggle with nuanced understanding of context, sarcasm, and implicit information in text.

Interpretability: The complex nature of deep learning models makes it challenging to interpret their decision-making process, which can be crucial in sensitive applications.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Simulating the trade-off between model size and performance
model_sizes = np.array([10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000])
performance = 80 + 10 * np.log10(model_sizes)
computational_cost = model_sizes ** 1.5

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(model_sizes, performance, label='Performance')
plt.plot(model_sizes, computational_cost / 1000, label='Computational Cost')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Model Size (Million Parameters)')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.title('Trade-off: Model Size vs Performance and Computational Cost')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Slide 15: Future Directions and Emerging Trends

The field of NLP is rapidly evolving, with several exciting trends emerging:

Multilingual and Cross-lingual Models: Developing models that can understand and generate text across multiple languages, bridging linguistic barriers.

Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning: Improving models' ability to perform tasks with minimal or no task-specific training data.

Efficient Transformers: Designing more computationally efficient transformer architectures to enable deployment on edge devices and reduce energy consumption.

Ethical AI: Addressing bias, fairness, and transparency in NLP models to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

```python
# Pseudocode for a hypothetical multilingual transformer
class MultilingualTransformer:
    def __init__(self, num_languages, model_dim):
        self.language_embeddings = Embedding(num_languages, model_dim)
        self.transformer_layers = TransformerLayers(model_dim)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, language_id):
        token_embeddings = self.token_embedding(input_ids)
        lang_embedding = self.language_embeddings(language_id)
        
        # Combine token and language embeddings
        embeddings = token_embeddings + lang_embedding
        
        # Process through transformer layers
        output = self.transformer_layers(embeddings)
        return output

# Usage
model = MultilingualTransformer(num_languages=100, model_dim=512)
output = model(input_ids, language_id)
```
