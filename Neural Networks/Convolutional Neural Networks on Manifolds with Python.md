## Convolutional Neural Networks on Manifolds with Python
Slide 1: Convolutional Neural Networks on Manifolds

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image processing tasks, but their application to non-Euclidean domains like manifolds presents unique challenges. This presentation explores how CNNs can be adapted to work on manifold-structured data, opening up new possibilities in fields such as 3D shape analysis, geospatial data processing, and social network analysis.

```python
import torch
import torch_geometric
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class ManifoldCNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(ManifoldCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu()
        return self.conv2(x, edge_index)
```

Slide 2: Understanding Manifolds

A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. In simpler terms, it's a curved surface that appears flat when viewed up close. Common examples include the surface of a sphere or a torus. Working with manifolds requires special considerations, as traditional CNN operations like convolution and pooling are not directly applicable.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

def generate_torus(R, r, n=100, m=100):
    theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, n)
    phi = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, m)
    theta, phi = np.meshgrid(theta, phi)
    x = (R + r*np.cos(phi)) * np.cos(theta)
    y = (R + r*np.cos(phi)) * np.sin(theta)
    z = r * np.sin(phi)
    return x, y, z

R, r = 3, 1
x, y, z = generate_torus(R, r)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot_surface(x, y, z, cmap='viridis')
plt.show()
```

Slide 3: Geodesic Convolution

To adapt convolution to manifolds, we introduce geodesic convolution. This operation considers the geodesic distance between points on the manifold, rather than Euclidean distance. Geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path between two points along the surface of the manifold.

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing
from torch_geometric.utils import get_geodesic_distance

class GeodesicConv(MessagePassing):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(GeodesicConv, self).__init__(aggr='mean')
        self.lin = torch.nn.Linear(in_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index, pos):
        edge_weight = get_geodesic_distance(pos, edge_index)
        return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x, edge_weight=edge_weight)

    def message(self, x_j, edge_weight):
        return self.lin(x_j) * edge_weight.view(-1, 1)
```

Slide 4: Graph Representation of Manifolds

To apply CNNs on manifolds, we often represent the manifold as a graph. Vertices correspond to points on the manifold, and edges connect nearby points. This graph structure allows us to define local neighborhoods and apply convolution-like operations.

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def create_manifold_graph(points, k=5):
    graph = nx.Graph()
    tree = spatial.cKDTree(points)
    distances, indices = tree.query(points, k=k+1)
    
    for i in range(len(points)):
        for j in indices[i][1:]:
            graph.add_edge(i, j, weight=np.linalg.norm(points[i]-points[j]))
    
    return graph

# Generate some random points on a 2D manifold
n_points = 100
points = np.random.rand(n_points, 2)

graph = create_manifold_graph(points)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
nx.draw(graph, points, node_size=20)
plt.show()
```

Slide 5: Spectral Graph Convolution

Spectral graph convolution is a technique that operates in the frequency domain of the graph Laplacian. It allows us to define convolution-like operations on graph-structured data, making it suitable for manifold CNNs.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class SpectralConv(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(SpectralConv, self).__init__()
        self.conv = GCNConv(in_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_weight=None):
        return F.relu(self.conv(x, edge_index, edge_weight))

# Usage
conv = SpectralConv(16, 32)
x = torch.randn(100, 16)  # 100 nodes, 16 features each
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))  # 500 edges
output = conv(x, edge_index)
```

Slide 6: Manifold Pooling

Pooling operations on manifolds require careful consideration of the manifold's geometry. One approach is to use graph clustering algorithms to group nearby points and then apply pooling within each cluster.

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.nn import voxel_grid
from torch_geometric.nn import max_pool

def manifold_pool(x, pos, batch, cluster_size):
    cluster = voxel_grid(pos, batch, cluster_size)
    return max_pool(cluster, x, batch)

# Usage
x = torch.randn(1000, 32)  # 1000 nodes, 32 features each
pos = torch.randn(1000, 3)  # 3D positions of nodes
batch = torch.zeros(1000, dtype=torch.long)  # All nodes belong to the same graph
cluster_size = 0.1

pooled_x, pooled_batch = manifold_pool(x, pos, batch, cluster_size)
```

Slide 7: Real-Life Example: 3D Shape Analysis

One practical application of CNNs on manifolds is 3D shape analysis. By representing 3D shapes as manifolds, we can use manifold CNNs to perform tasks such as shape classification, segmentation, and retrieval.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv, global_mean_pool

class ShapeNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        super(ShapeNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_features, 64)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(64, 128)
        self.conv3 = GCNConv(128, 256)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(256, num_classes)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index, batch = data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv3(x, edge_index))
        x = global_mean_pool(x, batch)
        return self.fc(x)

# Usage
model = ShapeNet(num_features=3, num_classes=10)
# Assume 'data' is a batch of 3D shapes represented as graphs
output = model(data)
```

Slide 8: Handling Non-Euclidean Geometries

Manifold CNNs must account for the curvature of the underlying space. This is particularly important when dealing with hyperbolic or spherical geometries, which are common in certain applications like hierarchical data analysis or geospatial processing.

```python
import torch
import geoopt

class HyperbolicConv(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(HyperbolicConv, self).__init__()
        self.weight = geoopt.ManifoldParameter(
            torch.Tensor(in_features, out_features),
            manifold=geoopt.PoincareBall()
        )
        self.reset_parameters()

    def reset_parameters(self):
        geoopt.nn.init.uniform_(self.weight, -0.001, 0.001)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x_j = x[edge_index[0]]
        x_i = x[edge_index[1]]
        hyp_dist = geoopt.manifolds.poincare.dist(x_i, x_j)
        return torch.matmul(hyp_dist, self.weight)

# Usage
conv = HyperbolicConv(16, 32)
x = torch.randn(100, 16)
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))
output = conv(x, edge_index)
```

Slide 9: Attention Mechanisms on Manifolds

Attention mechanisms can be adapted to work on manifold-structured data, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant parts of the input. This is particularly useful for tasks involving complex, non-uniform manifolds.

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.nn import GATConv

class ManifoldAttention(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(ManifoldAttention, self).__init__()
        self.att = GATConv(in_channels, out_channels, heads=4, concat=False)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        return self.att(x, edge_index)

# Usage
attention = ManifoldAttention(16, 32)
x = torch.randn(100, 16)
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))
output = attention(x, edge_index)
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Social Network Analysis

Social networks can be viewed as manifolds, where users are points and relationships form the manifold structure. Manifold CNNs can be used for tasks like community detection, influence prediction, and recommendation systems.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv, global_mean_pool

class SocialNetworkAnalyzer(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        super(SocialNetworkAnalyzer, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_features, 64)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(64, 128)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index, batch = data.x, data.edge_index, data.batch
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x, edge_index))
        x = global_mean_pool(x, batch)
        return self.fc(x)

# Usage
model = SocialNetworkAnalyzer(num_features=10, num_classes=5)
# Assume 'data' is a batch of social network graphs
output = model(data)
```

Slide 11: Manifold Regularization

Manifold regularization techniques can be used to enforce smoothness constraints on the learned functions with respect to the manifold structure. This helps in learning representations that are consistent with the underlying geometry of the data.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class ManifoldRegularizedGCN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        super(ManifoldRegularizedGCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_features, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        return self.conv2(x, edge_index)

    def manifold_regularization(self, x, edge_index):
        y = self.forward(x, edge_index)
        reg_loss = torch.mean(torch.sum((y[edge_index[0]] - y[edge_index[1]])**2, dim=1))
        return reg_loss

# Usage
model = ManifoldRegularizedGCN(num_features=10, num_classes=5)
x = torch.randn(100, 10)
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))
output = model(x, edge_index)
reg_loss = model.manifold_regularization(x, edge_index)
```

Slide 12: Handling Multi-Scale Features

Manifold CNNs can be designed to capture multi-scale features by incorporating operations that consider different neighborhood sizes or by using hierarchical graph representations.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv, SAGPooling

class MultiScaleManifoldCNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        super(MultiScaleManifoldCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(num_features, 32)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(32, 64)
        self.pool1 = SAGPooling(64, ratio=0.5)
        self.conv3 = GCNConv(64, 128)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index, batch):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x, edge_index))
        x, edge_index, _, batch, _, _ = self.pool1(x, edge_index, None, batch)
        x = F.relu(self.conv3(x, edge_index))
        x = torch.max(x, dim=0)[0]
        return self.fc(x)

# Usage
model = MultiScaleManifoldCNN(num_features=10, num_classes=5)
x = torch.randn(100, 10)
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))
batch = torch.zeros(100, dtype=torch.long)
output = model(x, edge_index, batch)
```

Slide 13: Challenges and Future Directions

While manifold CNNs have shown great promise, several challenges remain. These include dealing with very large-scale manifolds, handling dynamically changing manifold structures, and developing more efficient training algorithms for manifold-structured data. Future research directions may focus on developing more sophisticated manifold-aware attention mechanisms, exploring the use of manifold CNNs in generative models, investigating the theoretical foundations of manifold CNNs, and improving the scalability of manifold CNN architectures.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class FutureManifoldCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, num_classes):
        super(FutureManifoldCNN, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_features, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 32)
        )
        self.manifold_layer = ManifoldLayer(32, 32)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(32, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x, manifold_structure):
        x = self.encoder(x)
        x = self.manifold_layer(x, manifold_structure)
        return self.classifier(x)

class ManifoldLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(ManifoldLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(in_features, out_features))
        self.reset_parameters()

    def reset_parameters(self):
        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.weight)

    def forward(self, x, manifold_structure):
        # Placeholder for advanced manifold operations
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight)

# Usage
model = FutureManifoldCNN(num_features=10, num_classes=5)
x = torch.randn(100, 10)
manifold_structure = torch.randn(100, 100)  # Placeholder for manifold structure
output = model(x, manifold_structure)
```

Slide 14: Conclusion

Convolutional Neural Networks on Manifolds represent a significant advancement in deep learning, enabling the processing of complex, non-Euclidean data structures. By adapting traditional CNN operations to work on manifold-structured data, we can tackle a wide range of problems in fields such as computer graphics, social network analysis, and geospatial data processing. As research in this area progresses, we can expect to see more sophisticated manifold-aware neural network architectures and their application to increasingly complex real-world problems.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch_geometric.nn as gnn

class ManifoldCNNSummary(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super(ManifoldCNNSummary, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = gnn.GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = gnn.GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv3 = gnn.GCNConv(hidden_channels, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index).relu()
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index).relu()
        x = self.conv3(x, edge_index)
        return x

# Example usage
model = ManifoldCNNSummary(in_channels=3, hidden_channels=64, out_channels=10)
x = torch.randn(100, 3)
edge_index = torch.randint(0, 100, (2, 500))
output = model(x, edge_index)
```
