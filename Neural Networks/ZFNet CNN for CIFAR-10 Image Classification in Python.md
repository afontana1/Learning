## ZFNet CNN for CIFAR-10 Image Classification in Python
Slide 1: 

Introduction to ZFNet for CIFAR-10 Classification

ZFNet, introduced by Zeiler and Fergus in 2013, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that achieved state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. In this presentation, we will explore how to implement ZFNet using Python and the Pandas library for data preprocessing and manipulation.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import cifar10
```

Slide 2: 

Loading the CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. We can load the dataset using the Keras library.

```python
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
```

Slide 3: 

Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data to the ZFNet model, we need to preprocess it. This typically involves normalization and reshaping the data to the expected input format.

```python
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255

X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 32, 32, 3)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 32, 32, 3)
```

Slide 4: 

One-Hot Encoding the Labels

Since the labels in the CIFAR-10 dataset are integers, we need to one-hot encode them before using them as targets for the classification task.

```python
from keras.utils import to_categorical

y_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
```

Slide 5: 

Defining the ZFNet Architecture

ZFNet is a CNN architecture that consists of several convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. We can define the architecture using the Keras library.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, Flatten, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(96, (7, 7), strides=(2, 2), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 2)),
    # ... (Add more layers here)
])
```

Slide 6: 

Compiling the Model

Once the model architecture is defined, we need to compile it with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Slide 7: 

Training the Model

We can train the ZFNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the `fit` method from Keras.

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train,
          batch_size=64,
          epochs=50,
          validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

Slide 8: 

Evaluating the Model

After training, we can evaluate the model's performance on the test set using the `evaluate` method.

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%')
```

Slide 9: 
 
Making Predictions

To make predictions on new data, we can use the `predict` method of the trained model.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a new image
new_image = ... # Load image data here

# Preprocess the new image
new_image = new_image.reshape(1, 32, 32, 3)
new_image = new_image.astype('float32') / 255

# Make a prediction
prediction = model.predict(new_image)
class_idx = np.argmax(prediction)
class_name = cifar10.load_data()[1].class_names[class_idx]

# Display the image and prediction
plt.imshow(new_image.reshape(32, 32, 3))
plt.title(f'Prediction: {class_name}')
plt.show()
```

Slide 10: 

Data Augmentation

Data augmentation can be used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance. We can use the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras for this purpose.

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=10,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

train_generator = datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=64)
```

Slide 11: 

Transfer Learning with ZFNet

Transfer learning is a technique where we can use the pre-trained weights from a model trained on a large dataset and fine-tune it on our specific task. This can lead to better performance and faster convergence.

```python
from keras.applications import ZFNet

base_model = ZFNet(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(32, 32, 3))

# Freeze the base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add custom classification layers
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create the transfer learning model
transfer_model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile and train the model
transfer_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
transfer_model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

Slide 12: 

ZFNet Visualization

We can visualize the learned filters and feature maps of the ZFNet model to gain insights into its internal representations.

```python
from keras.models import Model

# Create a model that outputs the activations of a specific layer
layer_idx = 2  # Index of the layer to visualize
layer_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers[:layer_idx+1]]
activation_model = Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer_outputs)

# Visualize the activations
img = X_test[0].reshape(1, 32, 32, 3)
activations = activation_model.predict(img)

# Plot the activations
for i, activation in enumerate(activations):
    plt.subplot(1, len(activations), i+1)
    plt.imshow(activation[0, :, :, :])
    plt.title(f'Layer {i}')
plt.show()
```

Slide 13: 

ZFNet Performance Analysis

We can analyze the performance of the ZFNet model by evaluating its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
y_true = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)

accuracy = (y_pred == y_true).mean()
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
print(f'Precision: {precision:.4f}')
print(f'Recall: {recall:.4f}')
print(f'F1-score: {f1:.4f}')
```
