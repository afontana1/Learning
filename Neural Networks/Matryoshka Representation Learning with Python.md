## Matryoshka Representation Learning with Python
Slide 1: Introduction to Matryoshka Representation Learning

Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is an innovative approach in machine learning that focuses on creating nested representations of data. This technique is inspired by the Russian Matryoshka dolls, where smaller dolls are nested inside larger ones. In MRL, representations are organized in a hierarchical structure, allowing for efficient and flexible learning across multiple scales.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def matryoshka_representation(data, levels):
    representations = []
    for i in range(levels):
        # Create a representation at each level
        representation = np.mean(data.reshape(-1, 2**i), axis=1)
        representations.append(representation)
    return representations

# Generate sample data
data = np.random.rand(64)

# Create Matryoshka representations
levels = 4
representations = matryoshka_representation(data, levels)

# Visualize the representations
fig, axs = plt.subplots(levels, 1, figsize=(10, 12))
for i, rep in enumerate(representations):
    axs[i].plot(rep)
    axs[i].set_title(f"Level {i+1} Representation")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Core Concepts of MRL

MRL is built on the idea of creating a hierarchy of representations, each capturing different levels of abstraction. The lower levels represent fine-grained details, while higher levels capture more general concepts. This structure allows for efficient learning and transfer across tasks of varying complexity.

```python
class MatryoshkaNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_sizes):
        self.layers = []
        prev_size = input_size
        for size in hidden_sizes:
            self.layers.append(np.random.randn(prev_size, size))
            prev_size = size

    def forward(self, x):
        representations = [x]
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = np.maximum(0, x @ layer)  # ReLU activation
            representations.append(x)
        return representations

# Create a Matryoshka Network
input_size = 10
hidden_sizes = [8, 6, 4, 2]
network = MatryoshkaNetwork(input_size, hidden_sizes)

# Forward pass
input_data = np.random.rand(1, input_size)
representations = network.forward(input_data)

for i, rep in enumerate(representations):
    print(f"Level {i} representation shape: {rep.shape}")
```

Slide 3: Advantages of MRL

MRL offers several benefits, including improved efficiency in multi-task learning, better transfer learning capabilities, and the ability to handle tasks of varying complexity with a single model. It also allows for dynamic allocation of computational resources based on the task's difficulty.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MatryoshkaLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
        self.activation = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.activation(self.linear(x))

class MatryoshkaModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_sizes):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        prev_size = input_size
        for size in hidden_sizes:
            self.layers.append(MatryoshkaLayer(prev_size, size))
            prev_size = size

    def forward(self, x, depth):
        for i, layer in enumerate(self.layers):
            x = layer(x)
            if i + 1 == depth:
                return x
        return x

# Create a Matryoshka model
model = MatryoshkaModel(input_size=10, hidden_sizes=[8, 6, 4, 2])

# Forward pass with different depths
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)
for depth in range(1, len(model.layers) + 1):
    output = model(input_data, depth)
    print(f"Output at depth {depth}: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 4: MRL Architecture

The MRL architecture typically consists of a series of nested layers, each producing a representation at a different level of abstraction. The model can be designed to output representations at any desired level, allowing for flexibility in task-specific fine-tuning and adaptation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MRLBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.relu(self.bn(self.conv(x)))

class MRLNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, num_blocks):
        super().__init__()
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList()
        channels = input_channels
        for _ in range(num_blocks):
            self.blocks.append(MRLBlock(channels, channels * 2))
            channels *= 2

    def forward(self, x):
        representations = [x]
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block(x)
            representations.append(x)
        return representations

# Create an MRL network
mrl_net = MRLNetwork(input_channels=3, num_blocks=4)

# Forward pass
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
outputs = mrl_net(input_tensor)

for i, output in enumerate(outputs):
    print(f"Representation {i} shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 5: Training MRL Models

Training MRL models involves optimizing the network to produce useful representations at each level. This can be done through multi-task learning, where different tasks are associated with different levels of the hierarchy, or through auxiliary losses that encourage each level to capture meaningful information.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MRLTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, learning_rate):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
        self.criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    def train_step(self, input_data, target_data):
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = self.model(input_data)
        
        # Compute loss for each level
        losses = []
        for output, target in zip(outputs, target_data):
            losses.append(self.criterion(output, target))
        
        # Combine losses
        total_loss = sum(losses)
        total_loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        return total_loss.item()

# Assume we have a pre-defined MRL model
model = MRLNetwork(input_channels=3, num_blocks=4)

# Create a trainer
trainer = MRLTrainer(model, learning_rate=0.001)

# Simulated training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
    target_data = [torch.randn(1, 3 * (2**i), 64 // (2**i), 64 // (2**i)) for i in range(5)]
    
    loss = trainer.train_step(input_data, target_data)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss:.4f}")
```

Slide 6: Feature Extraction with MRL

MRL models excel at feature extraction, providing a rich set of features at various levels of abstraction. This is particularly useful in transfer learning scenarios, where pre-trained MRL models can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class MRLFeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained=True):
        super().__init__()
        # Use a pre-trained ResNet as the base model
        resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=pretrained)
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[:4]),  # Early layers
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[4:5]),  # Layer 1
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[5:6]),  # Layer 2
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[6:7]),  # Layer 3
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[7:])   # Final layers
        ])

    def forward(self, x):
        features = []
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
            features.append(x)
        return features

# Create the feature extractor
feature_extractor = MRLFeatureExtractor()

# Generate a random input image
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Extract features
with torch.no_grad():
    features = feature_extractor(input_image)

for i, feature in enumerate(features):
    print(f"Feature level {i + 1} shape: {feature.shape}")
```

Slide 7: MRL for Multi-task Learning

MRL is particularly well-suited for multi-task learning, where a single model is trained to perform multiple related tasks. The hierarchical nature of MRL allows different tasks to leverage representations at different levels of abstraction.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MRLMultiTaskModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_sizes, num_tasks):
        super().__init__()
        self.shared_layers = nn.ModuleList()
        prev_size = input_size
        for size in hidden_sizes:
            self.shared_layers.append(nn.Linear(prev_size, size))
            self.shared_layers.append(nn.ReLU())
            prev_size = size
        
        self.task_specific_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(hidden_sizes[-1], 1) for _ in range(num_tasks)])

    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.shared_layers:
            x = layer(x)
        
        outputs = []
        for task_layer in self.task_specific_layers:
            outputs.append(task_layer(x))
        
        return outputs

# Create a multi-task MRL model
model = MRLMultiTaskModel(input_size=10, hidden_sizes=[64, 32, 16], num_tasks=3)

# Generate random input
input_data = torch.randn(5, 10)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(input_data)

for i, output in enumerate(outputs):
    print(f"Task {i + 1} output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 8: MRL for Transfer Learning

MRL models are excellent for transfer learning due to their hierarchical structure. Pre-trained MRL models can be fine-tuned for new tasks by adapting different levels of the hierarchy based on the similarity between the source and target tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MRLTransferModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, pretrained_model, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.pretrained_layers = pretrained_model.layers[:-1]  # Remove the last layer
        self.adaptation_layer = nn.Linear(pretrained_model.layers[-1].out_features, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        for layer in self.pretrained_layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return self.adaptation_layer(x)

# Assume we have a pre-trained MRL model
pretrained_model = MRLNetwork(input_channels=3, num_blocks=4)

# Create a transfer learning model
transfer_model = MRLTransferModel(pretrained_model, num_classes=10)

# Freeze pre-trained layers
for param in transfer_model.pretrained_layers.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Only train the adaptation layer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(transfer_model.adaptation_layer.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulated fine-tuning
for epoch in range(5):
    input_data = torch.randn(32, 3, 64, 64)
    target = torch.randint(0, 10, (32,))
    
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = transfer_model(input_data)
    loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Slide 9: Implementing MRL with Attention Mechanisms

Attention mechanisms can be incorporated into MRL models to enhance their ability to focus on relevant information at each level of the hierarchy. This can lead to more effective representations and improved performance on various tasks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class AttentionMRLBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
            nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels // 4, kernel_size=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(out_channels // 4, out_channels, kernel_size=1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        conv_out = self.conv(x)
        attention_weights = self.attention(conv_out)
        return conv_out * attention_weights

class AttentionMRLNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, num_blocks):
        super().__init__()
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList()
        channels = input_channels
        for _ in range(num_blocks):
            self.blocks.append(AttentionMRLBlock(channels, channels * 2))
            channels *= 2

    def forward(self, x):
        representations = [x]
        for block in self.blocks:
            x = block(x)
            representations.append(x)
        return representations

# Create an Attention MRL network
attention_mrl_net = AttentionMRLNetwork(input_channels=3, num_blocks=4)

# Forward pass
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
outputs = attention_mrl_net(input_tensor)

for i, output in enumerate(outputs):
    print(f"Attention-enhanced representation {i} shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 10: MRL for Dimensionality Reduction

MRL can be effectively used for dimensionality reduction, creating a series of increasingly compact representations of the input data. This is particularly useful for visualization and preprocessing in high-dimensional datasets.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class MRLAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dims):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.ModuleList()
        self.decoder = nn.ModuleList()

        # Encoder
        dims = [input_dim] + hidden_dims
        for i in range(len(dims) - 1):
            self.encoder.append(nn.Linear(dims[i], dims[i+1]))
            self.encoder.append(nn.ReLU())

        # Decoder
        for i in range(len(dims) - 1, 0, -1):
            self.decoder.append(nn.Linear(dims[i], dims[i-1]))
            if i > 1:
                self.decoder.append(nn.ReLU())

    def forward(self, x):
        encodings = [x]
        for layer in self.encoder:
            x = layer(x)
            if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
                encodings.append(x)
        
        for layer in self.decoder:
            x = layer(x)
        
        return encodings, x

# Create and use the autoencoder
model = MRLAutoencoder(input_dim=784, hidden_dims=[256, 64, 16, 2])
input_data = torch.randn(100, 784)
encodings, reconstructed = model(input_data)

for i, encoding in enumerate(encodings):
    print(f"Encoding {i} shape: {encoding.shape}")
print(f"Reconstructed shape: {reconstructed.shape}")

# Visualize 2D encoding
plt.scatter(encodings[-1][:, 0].detach(), encodings[-1][:, 1].detach())
plt.title("2D MRL Encoding")
plt.show()
```

Slide 11: MRL in Computer Vision

MRL has found significant applications in computer vision tasks, where hierarchical representations can capture features at various scales, from low-level edges to high-level semantic concepts.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

class MRLVisionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
        self.features = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[:4]),
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[4:5]),
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[5:6]),
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[6:7]),
            nn.Sequential(*list(resnet.children())[7:-1])
        ])
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        representations = []
        for feature in self.features:
            x = feature(x)
            representations.append(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        output = self.classifier(x)
        return representations, output

# Create and use the vision model
model = MRLVisionModel(num_classes=10)
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
representations, output = model(input_image)

for i, rep in enumerate(representations):
    print(f"Representation {i} shape: {rep.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Slide 12: MRL for Natural Language Processing

In NLP, MRL can be applied to create hierarchical representations of text, capturing linguistic structures at various levels, from character-level features to sentence-level semantics.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MRLTextEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_dims):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        dims = [embed_dim] + hidden_dims
        for i in range(len(dims) - 1):
            self.layers.append(nn.LSTM(dims[i], dims[i+1], batch_first=True))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        representations = [x]
        for layer in self.layers:
            x, _ = layer(x)
            representations.append(x)
        return representations

# Create and use the text encoder
vocab_size = 10000
embed_dim = 300
hidden_dims = [256, 128, 64]
model = MRLTextEncoder(vocab_size, embed_dim, hidden_dims)

# Simulate input: batch_size=2, sequence_length=10
input_text = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (2, 10))
representations = model(input_text)

for i, rep in enumerate(representations):
    print(f"Representation {i} shape: {rep.shape}")
```

Slide 13: MRL for Reinforcement Learning

MRL can enhance reinforcement learning by providing hierarchical representations of states and actions, enabling more efficient exploration and learning of complex behaviors.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MRLValueNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, hidden_dims):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList()
        dims = [state_dim] + hidden_dims
        for i in range(len(dims) - 1):
            self.layers.append(nn.Linear(dims[i], dims[i+1]))
            self.layers.append(nn.ReLU())
        self.value_head = nn.Linear(dims[-1], 1)

    def forward(self, state):
        representations = [state]
        x = state
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
            if isinstance(layer, nn.Linear):
                representations.append(x)
        value = self.value_head(x)
        return representations, value

# Create and use the value network
state_dim = 4  # e.g., for CartPole environment
hidden_dims = [64, 32, 16]
model = MRLValueNetwork(state_dim, hidden_dims)

# Simulate input state
state = torch.randn(1, state_dim)
representations, value = model(state)

for i, rep in enumerate(representations):
    print(f"Representation {i} shape: {rep.shape}")
print(f"Value: {value.item():.4f}")
```

Slide 14: Challenges and Future Directions in MRL

While MRL has shown promise in various domains, there are still challenges to overcome and exciting directions for future research. These include developing more efficient training algorithms, exploring the theoretical foundations of MRL, and extending its applications to new domains.

```python
# Pseudocode for a potential future MRL architecture

class AdaptiveMRL:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, max_depth):
        self.layers = create_adaptive_layers(input_dim, max_depth)
    
    def forward(self, x, task_complexity):
        representations = [x]
        depth = determine_depth(task_complexity)
        
        for i in range(depth):
            x = self.layers[i](x)
            representations.append(x)
        
        return representations

    def determine_depth(self, task_complexity):
        # Algorithm to dynamically determine the required depth
        # based on the complexity of the current task
        pass

    def create_adaptive_layers(self, input_dim, max_depth):
        # Create layers that can adapt their parameters
        # based on the input and task requirements
        pass

# Usage
model = AdaptiveMRL(input_dim=100, max_depth=5)
input_data = generate_input_data()
task_complexity = assess_task_complexity()
representations = model.forward(input_data, task_complexity)
```
