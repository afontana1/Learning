## Mastering NER for Documents with Multiple Entities
Slide 1: Understanding NER with Data Enrichment

Natural Entity Recognition (NER) becomes more reliable when combined with data enrichment techniques. This approach helps overcome common challenges in extracting specific entities from documents containing multiple similar entities, such as addresses. The process involves using NER for initial entity detection and data enrichment for refinement and validation.

```python
# Basic NER with spaCy enrichment example
import spacy

def extract_and_enrich_address(text):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(text)
    addresses = []
    
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "LOC":
            # Enrich with additional validation
            if validate_address_format(ent.text):
                addresses.append(ent.text)
    return addresses
```

Slide 2: Address Validation Framework

A robust validation framework ensures that extracted addresses meet specific criteria. This helps distinguish between different types of addresses (billing, shipping, etc.) based on contextual clues and structural patterns.

```python
def validate_address_format(address_text):
    import re
    
    # Pattern for basic address validation
    pattern = r"""
    (?P<name>[\w\s]+)\s+
    (?P<street_number>\d+)\s+
    (?P<street>[\w\s]+)\s+
    (?P<city>[\w\s]+)\s+
    (?P<postal_code>\d{5})
    """
    
    match = re.match(pattern, address_text, re.VERBOSE)
    return bool(match)
```

Slide 3: Context-Based Entity Classification

When dealing with multiple addresses, context becomes crucial. This implementation uses surrounding text patterns to classify address types.

```python
def classify_address_type(text, address):
    # Define context windows (words before and after address)
    window_size = 5
    words = text.split()
    address_start = words.index(address.split()[0])
    
    # Extract context
    before_context = ' '.join(words[max(0, address_start-window_size):address_start])
    
    # Classify based on context patterns
    if 'bill to' in before_context.lower():
        return 'billing'
    elif 'ship to' in before_context.lower():
        return 'shipping'
    return 'unknown'
```

Slide 4: Data Enrichment Pipeline

A complete pipeline that combines NER with data enrichment requires several processing stages. Each stage adds additional information or validation to improve accuracy.

```python
class AddressEnrichmentPipeline:
    def process(self, text):
        # Stage 1: Extract addresses
        raw_addresses = extract_and_enrich_address(text)
        
        # Stage 2: Validate format
        valid_addresses = [addr for addr in raw_addresses 
                         if validate_address_format(addr)]
        
        # Stage 3: Classify address types
        classified_addresses = {addr: classify_address_type(text, addr)
                              for addr in valid_addresses}
        
        return classified_addresses
```

Slide 5: Real-Life Example - Package Delivery

System A practical implementation for a package delivery system that needs to extract both pickup and delivery addresses from customer requests.

```python
def process_delivery_request(request_text):
    pipeline = AddressEnrichmentPipeline()
    addresses = pipeline.process(request_text)
    
    # Example input text
    sample_text = """
    Please pickup the package from John Doe at 123 Oak Street 
    Downtown Seattle 98101 and deliver it to Jane Smith at 
    456 Pine Avenue Uptown Seattle 98102
    """
    
    result = process_delivery_request(sample_text)
```

Slide 6: Real-Life Example - Restaurant Chain

Locations Extracting and validating multiple restaurant locations from review websites or social media posts.

```python
def extract_restaurant_locations(review_text):
    pipeline = AddressEnrichmentPipeline()
    locations = pipeline.process(review_text)
    
    # Filter only valid restaurant addresses
    restaurant_locations = {
        addr: details for addr, details in locations.items()
        if validate_restaurant_address(addr)
    }
    return restaurant_locations
```

Slide 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases

Robust error handling ensures the system can handle missing or malformed addresses gracefully.

```python
def handle_address_extraction(text):
    try:
        addresses = extract_and_enrich_address(text)
        if not addresses:
            return {"error": "No valid addresses found"}
        
        return {"addresses": addresses}
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "error": f"Address extraction failed: {str(e)}",
            "original_text": text
        }
```

Slide 8: Performance Optimization

Implementing caching and batch processing for improved performance when dealing with large volumes of text.

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_address_extraction(text):
    return extract_and_enrich_address(text)

def batch_process_documents(documents, batch_size=100):
    results = []
    for i in range(0, len(documents), batch_size):
        batch = documents[i:i + batch_size]
        results.extend([cached_address_extraction(doc) for doc in batch])
    return results
```
