## Vector Databases Powering AI and Machine Learning
Slide 1: Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector data. They are becoming increasingly important in the era of AI and machine learning, where complex data representations are common.

Slide 2: What are Vectors?

Vectors are mathematical objects representing data points in multi-dimensional space. In the context of machine learning, vectors often represent features or embeddings of data.

Slide 3: Code for Vector Representation

```python
# Vector representation in Python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, *components):
        self.components = list(components)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({', '.join(map(str, self.components))})"

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.components)

# Example usage
v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5)

print(f"v1: {v1}, dimension: {len(v1)}")
print(f"v2: {v2}, dimension: {len(v2)}")
```

Slide 4: Why Vector Databases?

Traditional databases struggle with high-dimensional data and similarity searches. Vector databases are optimized for these tasks, making them crucial for modern AI applications.

Slide 5: Source Code for Vector Distance Calculation

```python
import math

def euclidean_distance(v1, v2):
    if len(v1) != len(v2):
        raise ValueError("Vectors must have the same dimension")
    
    return math.sqrt(sum((a - b) ** 2 for a, b in zip(v1, v2)))

# Example usage
vector1 = [1, 2, 3]
vector2 = [4, 5, 6]

distance = euclidean_distance(vector1, vector2)
print(f"Euclidean distance between {vector1} and {vector2}: {distance:.2f}")
```

Slide 6: Efficient Similarity Search

Vector databases use specialized indexing techniques like LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) or HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) to perform fast similarity searches in high-dimensional spaces.

Slide 7: Source Code for Simple LSH Implementation

```python
import random

class SimpleLSH:
    def __init__(self, dim, num_hashes):
        self.dim = dim
        self.num_hashes = num_hashes
        self.hash_functions = [self._random_vector() for _ in range(num_hashes)]

    def _random_vector(self):
        return [random.gauss(0, 1) for _ in range(self.dim)]

    def hash(self, vector):
        return [1 if sum(a*b for a, b in zip(v, vector)) >= 0 else 0
                for v in self.hash_functions]

# Example usage
lsh = SimpleLSH(dim=3, num_hashes=5)
vector = [1, 2, 3]
hash_code = lsh.hash(vector)
print(f"LSH hash code for {vector}: {hash_code}")
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Recommendation Systems

Vector databases power recommendation systems by storing item and user embeddings. They enable quick retrieval of similar items or users based on their vector representations.

Slide 9: Source Code for Simple Recommendation System

```python
def cosine_similarity(v1, v2):
    dot_product = sum(a*b for a, b in zip(v1, v2))
    magnitude1 = math.sqrt(sum(a*a for a in v1))
    magnitude2 = math.sqrt(sum(b*b for b in v2))
    return dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)

def recommend_items(user_vector, item_vectors, top_n=3):
    similarities = [(i, cosine_similarity(user_vector, item_vector))
                    for i, item_vector in enumerate(item_vectors)]
    return sorted(similarities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:top_n]

# Example usage
user_vector = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]
item_vectors = [
    [0.4, 0.4, 0.2],
    [0.6, 0.2, 0.2],
    [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],
    [0.7, 0.1, 0.2]
]

recommendations = recommend_items(user_vector, item_vectors)
print("Top recommendations (item_id, similarity):")
for item_id, similarity in recommendations:
    print(f"Item {item_id}: {similarity:.2f}")
```

Slide 10: Real-Life Example: Image Similarity Search

Vector databases enable efficient image similarity search by storing and querying image feature vectors extracted from deep learning models.

Slide 11: Source Code for Image Feature Extraction (Pseudo-code)

```python
# Note: This is pseudo-code and requires a pre-trained CNN model
def extract_image_features(image_path, model):
    image = load_image(image_path)
    preprocessed_image = preprocess(image)
    features = model.extract_features(preprocessed_image)
    return features

def find_similar_images(query_image, image_database, top_n=5):
    query_features = extract_image_features(query_image, model)
    similarities = []
    for image_id, features in image_database.items():
        similarity = cosine_similarity(query_features, features)
        similarities.append((image_id, similarity))
    return sorted(similarities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:top_n]

# Example usage (pseudo-code)
image_database = load_image_database()
query_image = "path/to/query/image.jpg"
similar_images = find_similar_images(query_image, image_database)
print("Similar images:", similar_images)
```

Slide 12: Scalability and Performance

Vector databases are designed to handle large-scale data and provide fast query responses, making them suitable for applications with millions or billions of vectors.

Slide 13: Source Code for Vector Database Benchmark

```python
import time
import random

class SimpleVectorDB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectors = {}

    def insert(self, id, vector):
        self.vectors[id] = vector

    def search(self, query_vector, k=1):
        return sorted(
            [(id, cosine_similarity(query_vector, v)) for id, v in self.vectors.items()],
            key=lambda x: x[1],
            reverse=True
        )[:k]

# Benchmark function
def benchmark_vector_db(num_vectors, vector_dim, num_queries):
    db = SimpleVectorDB()
    
    # Insert vectors
    start_time = time.time()
    for i in range(num_vectors):
        vector = [random.random() for _ in range(vector_dim)]
        db.insert(i, vector)
    insert_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Perform queries
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(num_queries):
        query_vector = [random.random() for _ in range(vector_dim)]
        db.search(query_vector, k=10)
    query_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    print(f"Insertion time for {num_vectors} vectors: {insert_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Query time for {num_queries} queries: {query_time:.2f} seconds")

# Run benchmark
benchmark_vector_db(num_vectors=100000, vector_dim=128, num_queries=1000)
```
