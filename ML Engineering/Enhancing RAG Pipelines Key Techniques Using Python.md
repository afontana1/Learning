## Enhancing RAG Pipelines Key Techniques Using Python
Slide 1: Introduction to RAG Pipeline Enhancement

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are crucial in modern natural language processing. This presentation explores three advanced techniques to improve query handling in RAG systems: Sub-Question Decomposition, Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE), and Step-Back Prompting. These methods aim to enhance the accuracy and relevance of responses in information retrieval and generation tasks.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulating RAG pipeline performance
techniques = ['Baseline', 'Sub-Question', 'HyDE', 'Step-Back']
accuracy = np.array([0.7, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9])
relevance = np.array([0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
x = np.arange(len(techniques))
width = 0.35

ax.bar(x - width/2, accuracy, width, label='Accuracy')
ax.bar(x + width/2, relevance, width, label='Relevance')

ax.set_ylabel('Score')
ax.set_title('RAG Pipeline Performance Comparison')
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(techniques)
ax.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Slide 2: Sub-Question Decomposition Overview

Sub-Question Decomposition is a technique that breaks down complex queries into simpler, more manageable sub-questions. This approach allows the RAG system to tackle intricate problems by addressing their components individually, leading to more accurate and comprehensive responses.

```python
def decompose_question(main_question):
    # Simulating question decomposition
    sub_questions = [
        "What is the main topic?",
        "What are the key components?",
        "Are there any related concepts?",
        "What are the practical applications?"
    ]
    return sub_questions

main_question = "Explain the impact of climate change on global ecosystems."
sub_questions = decompose_question(main_question)

print("Main Question:", main_question)
print("Sub-Questions:")
for i, sq in enumerate(sub_questions, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {sq}")
```

Slide 3: Implementing Sub-Question Decomposition

To implement Sub-Question Decomposition, we can use natural language processing techniques to analyze the main question and generate relevant sub-questions. Here's a simple example using spaCy for named entity recognition and dependency parsing:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def generate_sub_questions(main_question):
    doc = nlp(main_question)
    sub_questions = []

    # Generate sub-questions based on named entities
    for ent in doc.ents:
        sub_questions.append(f"What is {ent.text}?")

    # Generate sub-questions based on noun chunks
    for chunk in doc.noun_chunks:
        sub_questions.append(f"Can you elaborate on {chunk.text}?")

    return sub_questions

main_question = "How does artificial intelligence impact the job market in the technology sector?"
sub_questions = generate_sub_questions(main_question)

print("Main Question:", main_question)
print("Generated Sub-Questions:")
for i, sq in enumerate(sub_questions, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {sq}")
```

Slide 4: Benefits of Sub-Question Decomposition

Sub-Question Decomposition offers several advantages in RAG pipelines. It improves the system's ability to handle complex queries by breaking them down into manageable parts. This approach often leads to more comprehensive and accurate responses, as each sub-question can be processed independently and then combined for a holistic answer.

```python
import random

def simulate_rag_pipeline(question, use_decomposition=False):
    base_accuracy = 0.7
    base_comprehensiveness = 0.6

    if use_decomposition:
        sub_questions = generate_sub_questions(question)
        accuracies = [base_accuracy + random.uniform(0, 0.2) for _ in sub_questions]
        comprehensiveness = min(1.0, base_comprehensiveness + 0.1 * len(sub_questions))
        overall_accuracy = sum(accuracies) / len(accuracies)
    else:
        overall_accuracy = base_accuracy
        comprehensiveness = base_comprehensiveness

    return overall_accuracy, comprehensiveness

question = "Explain the economic implications of renewable energy adoption in developing countries."

standard_acc, standard_comp = simulate_rag_pipeline(question)
decomp_acc, decomp_comp = simulate_rag_pipeline(question, use_decomposition=True)

print(f"Standard RAG - Accuracy: {standard_acc:.2f}, Comprehensiveness: {standard_comp:.2f}")
print(f"With Decomposition - Accuracy: {decomp_acc:.2f}, Comprehensiveness: {decomp_comp:.2f}")
```

Slide 5: Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) Concept

Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) is an innovative technique that generates a hypothetical perfect document that would answer the query, and then uses this document for retrieval. This approach bridges the gap between the query and relevant documents in the corpus, potentially improving retrieval accuracy.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def generate_hypothetical_document(query):
    # Simulating the generation of a hypothetical document
    return f"This document contains information about {query}. It provides a comprehensive answer to the query, discussing various aspects and implications."

def embed_document(document):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    return vectorizer.fit_transform([document]).toarray()[0]

query = "What are the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive function?"
hypothetical_doc = generate_hypothetical_document(query)
embedding = embed_document(hypothetical_doc)

print("Query:", query)
print("Hypothetical Document:", hypothetical_doc)
print("Embedding (first 10 elements):", embedding[:10])
```

Slide 6: Implementing HyDE in RAG Pipeline

To implement HyDE in a RAG pipeline, we first generate a hypothetical document based on the query, then use this document to retrieve relevant information from the corpus. Here's a simplified example of how this process might work:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def generate_hyde_embedding(query):
    hypothetical_doc = generate_hypothetical_document(query)
    return embed_document(hypothetical_doc)

def retrieve_documents(query_embedding, document_embeddings, top_k=3):
    similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], document_embeddings)[0]
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]
    return top_indices, similarities[top_indices]

# Simulating a document corpus
corpus = [
    "Sleep deprivation affects cognitive function negatively.",
    "Lack of sleep can impair memory and decision-making.",
    "Cognitive performance declines with insufficient sleep.",
    "Regular exercise can improve sleep quality."
]

document_embeddings = np.array([embed_document(doc) for doc in corpus])

query = "How does sleep deprivation impact cognitive abilities?"
hyde_embedding = generate_hyde_embedding(query)

top_indices, similarities = retrieve_documents(hyde_embedding, document_embeddings)

print("Query:", query)
print("\nTop relevant documents:")
for i, (index, similarity) in enumerate(zip(top_indices, similarities), 1):
    print(f"{i}. {corpus[index]} (Similarity: {similarity:.2f})")
```

Slide 7: Advantages of HyDE in RAG Systems

HyDE offers several benefits in RAG pipelines, including improved retrieval accuracy and better handling of semantic gaps between queries and documents. By generating a hypothetical perfect document, HyDE creates a bridge between the user's query intent and the actual content in the corpus.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compare_hyde_performance(queries, use_hyde=True):
    retrieval_accuracy = []
    for query in queries:
        if use_hyde:
            embedding = generate_hyde_embedding(query)
        else:
            embedding = embed_document(query)
        
        _, similarities = retrieve_documents(embedding, document_embeddings, top_k=1)
        retrieval_accuracy.append(similarities[0])
    
    return retrieval_accuracy

queries = [
    "Effects of sleep on memory",
    "Impact of sleep deprivation on decision-making",
    "Relationship between sleep and cognitive performance",
    "Sleep and exercise connection"
]

standard_accuracy = compare_hyde_performance(queries, use_hyde=False)
hyde_accuracy = compare_hyde_performance(queries, use_hyde=True)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(range(len(queries)), standard_accuracy, alpha=0.5, label='Standard Retrieval')
plt.bar(range(len(queries)), hyde_accuracy, alpha=0.5, label='HyDE')
plt.xlabel('Queries')
plt.ylabel('Retrieval Accuracy')
plt.title('HyDE vs Standard Retrieval Performance')
plt.legend()
plt.xticks(range(len(queries)), [f'Q{i+1}' for i in range(len(queries))], rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Average Standard Accuracy:", sum(standard_accuracy) / len(standard_accuracy))
print("Average HyDE Accuracy:", sum(hyde_accuracy) / len(hyde_accuracy))
```

Slide 8: Step-Back Prompting Introduction

Step-Back Prompting is a technique that encourages the model to take a broader perspective before addressing the specific query. This approach can lead to more comprehensive and contextually aware responses, especially for complex or nuanced questions.

```python
def step_back_prompt(query):
    step_back_questions = [
        f"What is the broader context of {query}?",
        f"What are the key concepts related to {query}?",
        f"How does {query} fit into a larger framework or system?",
        f"What are the underlying principles or theories relevant to {query}?"
    ]
    return random.choice(step_back_questions)

query = "How does quantum entanglement affect quantum computing?"
step_back_question = step_back_prompt(query)

print("Original Query:", query)
print("Step-Back Question:", step_back_question)
```

Slide 9: Implementing Step-Back Prompting in RAG

To implement Step-Back Prompting in a RAG pipeline, we first generate a step-back question, use it to retrieve broader context, and then combine this information with the original query. Here's a simplified example:

```python
def rag_with_step_back(query, corpus):
    # Generate step-back question
    step_back_q = step_back_prompt(query)
    
    # Retrieve documents for step-back question
    step_back_embedding = embed_document(step_back_q)
    sb_indices, _ = retrieve_documents(step_back_embedding, document_embeddings, top_k=2)
    
    # Retrieve documents for original query
    query_embedding = embed_document(query)
    q_indices, _ = retrieve_documents(query_embedding, document_embeddings, top_k=2)
    
    # Combine and deduplicate results
    all_indices = list(set(sb_indices) | set(q_indices))
    
    return [corpus[i] for i in all_indices]

# Simulated corpus
corpus = [
    "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics.",
    "Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical principles.",
    "Entanglement is crucial for quantum algorithm speedup.",
    "Quantum computers can solve certain problems faster than classical computers."
]

document_embeddings = np.array([embed_document(doc) for doc in corpus])

query = "How does quantum entanglement affect quantum computing?"
results = rag_with_step_back(query, corpus)

print("Query:", query)
print("\nRetrieved Documents:")
for i, doc in enumerate(results, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {doc}")
```

Slide 10: Benefits of Step-Back Prompting

Step-Back Prompting enhances RAG pipelines by providing a broader context and more comprehensive understanding of the query topic. This technique can lead to more informative and well-rounded responses, especially for complex or multifaceted questions.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_response_quality(use_step_back=False):
    base_comprehensiveness = 0.6
    base_relevance = 0.7
    
    if use_step_back:
        comprehensiveness = min(1.0, base_comprehensiveness + random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))
        relevance = min(1.0, base_relevance + random.uniform(0.05, 0.2))
    else:
        comprehensiveness = base_comprehensiveness + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
        relevance = base_relevance + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
    
    return comprehensiveness, relevance

num_simulations = 1000
standard_results = [simulate_response_quality() for _ in range(num_simulations)]
step_back_results = [simulate_response_quality(True) for _ in range(num_simulations)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(*zip(*standard_results), alpha=0.5, label='Standard RAG')
plt.scatter(*zip(*step_back_results), alpha=0.5, label='With Step-Back')
plt.xlabel('Comprehensiveness')
plt.ylabel('Relevance')
plt.title('Response Quality: Standard RAG vs Step-Back Prompting')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Standard RAG - Avg Comprehensiveness: {:.2f}, Avg Relevance: {:.2f}".format(
    sum(r[0] for r in standard_results) / num_simulations,
    sum(r[1] for r in standard_results) / num_simulations
))
print("With Step-Back - Avg Comprehensiveness: {:.2f}, Avg Relevance: {:.2f}".format(
    sum(r[0] for r in step_back_results) / num_simulations,
    sum(r[1] for r in step_back_results) / num_simulations
))
```

Slide 11: Combining Techniques for Enhanced RAG Pipelines

By integrating Sub-Question Decomposition, Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE), and Step-Back Prompting, we can create a more robust and effective RAG pipeline. This combined approach leverages the strengths of each technique to provide more accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses.

```python
def enhanced_rag_pipeline(query, corpus):
    # Step 1: Sub-Question Decomposition
    sub_questions = generate_sub_questions(query)
    
    # Step 2: Apply HyDE to each sub-question
    hyde_embeddings = [generate_hyde_embedding(sq) for sq in sub_questions]
    
    # Step 3: Apply Step-Back Prompting
    step_back_q = step_back_prompt(query)
    sb_embedding = generate_hyde_embedding(step_back_q)
    
    # Step 4: Retrieve documents
    all_embeddings = hyde_embeddings + [sb_embedding]
    document_embeddings = np.array([embed_document(doc) for doc in corpus])
    
    relevant_docs = set()
    for emb in all_embeddings:
        indices, _ = retrieve_documents(emb, document_embeddings, top_k=2)
        relevant_docs.update(indices)
    
    return [corpus[i] for i in relevant_docs]

# Example usage
query = "Explain the role of neural plasticity in learning and memory formation."
corpus = [
    "Neural plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt.",
    "Learning involves forming new neural connections in the brain.",
    "Memory formation is closely linked to synaptic plasticity.",
    "The hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory consolidation.",
    "Neuroplasticity decreases with age but can be promoted through mental exercises."
]

results = enhanced_rag_pipeline(query, corpus)

print("Query:", query)
print("\nRetrieved Documents:")
for i, doc in enumerate(results, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {doc}")
```

Slide 12: Performance Evaluation of Enhanced RAG Pipeline

To assess the effectiveness of our enhanced RAG pipeline, we'll compare its performance against a standard RAG approach. We'll use metrics such as relevance, comprehensiveness, and response time to evaluate the improvements.

```python
import time
import random

def simulate_performance(pipeline_type, num_queries=100):
    relevance_scores = []
    comprehensiveness_scores = []
    response_times = []

    for _ in range(num_queries):
        start_time = time.time()
        
        if pipeline_type == "standard":
            # Simulate standard RAG pipeline
            relevance = random.uniform(0.5, 0.8)
            comprehensiveness = random.uniform(0.4, 0.7)
            time.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 0.3))  # Simulate processing time
        else:
            # Simulate enhanced RAG pipeline
            relevance = random.uniform(0.7, 0.95)
            comprehensiveness = random.uniform(0.6, 0.9)
            time.sleep(random.uniform(0.2, 0.5))  # Simulate processing time
        
        end_time = time.time()
        
        relevance_scores.append(relevance)
        comprehensiveness_scores.append(comprehensiveness)
        response_times.append(end_time - start_time)
    
    return {
        "avg_relevance": sum(relevance_scores) / len(relevance_scores),
        "avg_comprehensiveness": sum(comprehensiveness_scores) / len(comprehensiveness_scores),
        "avg_response_time": sum(response_times) / len(response_times)
    }

standard_performance = simulate_performance("standard")
enhanced_performance = simulate_performance("enhanced")

print("Standard RAG Performance:")
print(f"Average Relevance: {standard_performance['avg_relevance']:.2f}")
print(f"Average Comprehensiveness: {standard_performance['avg_comprehensiveness']:.2f}")
print(f"Average Response Time: {standard_performance['avg_response_time']:.2f} seconds")

print("\nEnhanced RAG Performance:")
print(f"Average Relevance: {enhanced_performance['avg_relevance']:.2f}")
print(f"Average Comprehensiveness: {enhanced_performance['avg_comprehensiveness']:.2f}")
print(f"Average Response Time: {enhanced_performance['avg_response_time']:.2f} seconds")
```

Slide 13: Real-world Application: Improved Customer Support

Let's explore a real-world application of our enhanced RAG pipeline in a customer support scenario. We'll demonstrate how the combined techniques can provide more accurate and comprehensive responses to customer queries.

```python
def customer_support_rag(query, knowledge_base):
    # Simulate enhanced RAG pipeline for customer support
    sub_questions = generate_sub_questions(query)
    relevant_info = []
    
    for sq in sub_questions:
        hyde_emb = generate_hyde_embedding(sq)
        docs = retrieve_documents(hyde_emb, knowledge_base, top_k=1)
        relevant_info.extend(docs)
    
    step_back_q = step_back_prompt(query)
    sb_docs = retrieve_documents(generate_hyde_embedding(step_back_q), knowledge_base, top_k=1)
    relevant_info.extend(sb_docs)
    
    return generate_response(query, relevant_info)

# Simulated knowledge base
knowledge_base = [
    "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase.",
    "Shipping typically takes 3-5 business days for domestic orders.",
    "We offer free shipping on orders over $50.",
    "Our products come with a 1-year warranty against defects.",
    "Customer satisfaction is our top priority."
]

query = "What's your return policy, and how long does shipping usually take?"
response = customer_support_rag(query, knowledge_base)

print("Customer Query:", query)
print("\nGenerated Response:")
print(response)
```

Slide 14: Future Directions and Potential Improvements

As we conclude our exploration of these advanced RAG pipeline techniques, let's consider future directions and potential improvements. These may include incorporating more advanced language models, developing adaptive query handling strategies, and exploring ways to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance gains.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulating future performance projections
techniques = ['Current', 'Advanced LMs', 'Adaptive Strategies', 'Optimized Compute']
accuracy = [0.85, 0.90, 0.93, 0.95]
response_time = [1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7]  # Normalized, lower is better

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

ax1.set_xlabel('Techniques')
ax1.set_ylabel('Accuracy', color='tab:blue')
ax1.plot(techniques, accuracy, color='tab:blue', marker='o')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='tab:blue')

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
ax2.set_ylabel('Normalized Response Time', color='tab:orange')
ax2.plot(techniques, response_time, color='tab:orange', marker='s')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='tab:orange')

plt.title('Projected RAG Pipeline Improvements')
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Potential future improvements:")
for t, a, r in zip(techniques, accuracy, response_time):
    print(f"{t}: Accuracy: {a:.2f}, Normalized Response Time: {r:.2f}")
```
