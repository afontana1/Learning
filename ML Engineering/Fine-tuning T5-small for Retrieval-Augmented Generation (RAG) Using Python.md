## Fine-tuning T5-small for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Using Python

Slide 1: 

Introduction to Fine-tuning T5-small for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model to a specific task or domain. In this case, we will fine-tune the T5-small model, a variant of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, to excel at RAG, which combines retrieval and generation for open-domain question answering.

```python
# No code for this slide
```

Slide 2: 

Setting up the Environment

Before we start, we need to set up our environment by installing the required libraries and dependencies. We will use the DSPy (Distributed Semantic Precomputing) library, which is a Python library for efficient text retrieval and encoding.

```python
!pip install dspy-ml
```

Slide 3: 

Importing Libraries

Import the necessary libraries and modules for fine-tuning and working with the T5-small model and DSPy.

```python
import dspy
import transformers
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer
```

Slide 4: 

Loading the T5-small Model and Tokenizer

Load the pre-trained T5-small model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

```python
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('t5-small')
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('t5-small')
```

Slide 5: 

Preparing the Dataset

Prepare your dataset for fine-tuning. The dataset should be in a specific format, with input and output sequences. Here's an example of how to prepare a dataset for question-answering tasks.

```python
dataset = [
    {"input": "Question: What is the capital of France?", "output": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"input": "Question: How many planets are in our solar system?", "output": "There are 8 planets in our solar system."},
    # Add more examples
]
```

Slide 6: 

Encoding the Dataset

Encode the input and output sequences using the T5 tokenizer.

```python
def encode_dataset(dataset, tokenizer):
    encoded_dataset = []
    for example in dataset:
        input_encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(example["input"], return_tensors="pt", padding="max_length", max_length=512, truncation=True)
        output_encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(example["output"], return_tensors="pt", padding="max_length", max_length=512, truncation=True)
        encoded_dataset.append({"input_ids": input_encoding["input_ids"], "attention_mask": input_encoding["attention_mask"], "labels": output_encoding["input_ids"]})
    return encoded_dataset
```

Slide 7: 

Setting up the Semantic Retriever

Set up the semantic retriever using DSPy for efficient text retrieval.

```python
semantic_retriever = dspy.SemanticRetriever(model_path="facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base")
```

Slide 8: 

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Function

Define a function that combines retrieval and generation for open-domain question answering.

```python
def rag(question, tokenizer, model, retriever):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(question, return_tensors="pt")
    retrieved_docs = retriever.retrieve(question, top_k=5)
    retrieved_text = "\n".join([doc.text for doc in retrieved_docs])
    combined_input = "Question: " + question + " Context: " + retrieved_text
    combined_input_ids = tokenizer.encode(combined_input, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(combined_input_ids, max_length=512, early_stopping=True)
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return answer
```

Slide 9: 

Fine-tuning the T5-small Model

Fine-tune the T5-small model on your encoded dataset using the Hugging Face Trainer.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="output", num_train_epochs=3, per_device_train_batch_size=4, warmup_steps=500, weight_decay=0.01, logging_dir="logs")

trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=encoded_dataset)

trainer.train()
```

Slide 10: 

Saving the Fine-tuned Model

Save the fine-tuned model for future use.

```python
model.save_pretrained("fine-tuned-t5-small")
```

Slide 11:

Using the Fine-tuned Model for RAG

Use the fine-tuned T5-small model with the RAG function for open-domain question answering.

```python
question = "What is the largest planet in our solar system?"
answer = rag(question, tokenizer, model, semantic_retriever)
print(answer)
```

Slide 12: 

Evaluation and Testing

Evaluate the performance of your fine-tuned model on a test dataset or benchmark. You can use metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, or exact match accuracy.

```python
# Code for evaluation and testing will depend on the specific dataset and metrics
```
