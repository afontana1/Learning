## Fine-Tuning MISTRAL AI Model with Python
Slide 1: Fine-Tuning MISTRAL AI Model

Fine-tuning the MISTRAL AI model involves adapting a pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains. This process enhances the model's performance on targeted applications while leveraging the knowledge acquired during pre-training. We'll explore the steps, techniques, and best practices for fine-tuning MISTRAL using Python.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

print(f"Loaded {model_name} model and tokenizer")
```

Slide 2: Understanding MISTRAL AI

MISTRAL AI is a powerful language model developed by Mistral AI. It's designed to generate human-like text and can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks. The model uses a transformer architecture and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of text data.

```python
# Exploring model architecture
print(f"Model architecture: {model.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Number of parameters: {model.num_parameters():,}")
print(f"Vocabulary size: {len(tokenizer)}")
```

Slide 3: Preparing the Dataset

Before fine-tuning, we need to prepare our dataset. This involves collecting and preprocessing the data specific to our task. For this example, we'll use a sentiment analysis dataset.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
train_data = dataset["train"]
test_data = dataset["test"]

print(f"Training samples: {len(train_data)}")
print(f"Testing samples: {len(test_data)}")
print(f"Sample text: {train_data[0]['text'][:100]}...")
print(f"Sample label: {train_data[0]['label']}")
```

Slide 4: Tokenization and Encoding

To prepare our data for the model, we need to tokenize and encode it. This process converts text into numerical representations that the model can understand.

```python
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=512)

tokenized_train = train_data.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
tokenized_test = test_data.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

print(f"Encoded input_ids shape: {tokenized_train[0]['input_ids'][:10]}")
print(f"Encoded attention_mask shape: {tokenized_train[0]['attention_mask'][:10]}")
```

Slide 5: Defining the Training Arguments

We need to set up the training arguments that control various aspects of the fine-tuning process, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=10,
)

print(f"Learning rate: {training_args.learning_rate}")
print(f"Batch size: {training_args.per_device_train_batch_size}")
print(f"Number of epochs: {training_args.num_train_epochs}")
```

Slide 6: Creating a Custom Dataset

To fine-tune MISTRAL for our specific task, we need to create a custom dataset that combines the input text with the target labels.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class SentimentDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
        self.encodings = encodings
        self.labels = labels

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
        item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx])
        return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

train_dataset = SentimentDataset(tokenized_train, train_data["label"])
test_dataset = SentimentDataset(tokenized_test, test_data["label"])

print(f"Training dataset size: {len(train_dataset)}")
print(f"Testing dataset size: {len(test_dataset)}")
```

Slide 7: Defining the Model for Fine-Tuning

We need to adapt the MISTRAL model for our specific task. In this case, we'll add a classification head for sentiment analysis.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification

num_labels = 2  # Binary classification for sentiment analysis
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=num_labels)

print(f"Model architecture: {model.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Number of parameters: {model.num_parameters():,}")
```

Slide 8: Setting Up the Trainer

The Trainer class from the transformers library simplifies the fine-tuning process by handling the training loop, evaluation, and logging.

```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=test_dataset,
)

print("Trainer initialized with the following components:")
print(f"Model: {trainer.model.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Optimizer: {trainer.optimizer.__class__.__name__}")
print(f"Scheduler: {trainer.lr_scheduler.__class__.__name__}")
```

Slide 9: Fine-Tuning the Model

Now we can start the fine-tuning process. This will update the model's parameters to improve its performance on our specific task.

```python
print("Starting fine-tuning...")
trainer.train()

print("Fine-tuning completed")
print(f"Total training steps: {trainer.state.global_step}")
print(f"Final training loss: {trainer.state.log_history[-1]['loss']:.4f}")
```

Slide 10: Evaluating the Fine-Tuned Model

After fine-tuning, we need to evaluate the model's performance on our test dataset to see how well it has learned the task.

```python
eval_results = trainer.evaluate()

print("Evaluation results:")
print(f"Loss: {eval_results['eval_loss']:.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy: {eval_results['eval_accuracy']:.4f}")
```

Slide 11: Saving the Fine-Tuned Model

To use our fine-tuned model in the future, we need to save it along with its configuration and tokenizer.

```python
output_dir = "./fine_tuned_mistral"
model.save_pretrained(output_dir)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_dir)

print(f"Model saved to: {output_dir}")
print("Saved files:")
print("\n".join(os.listdir(output_dir)))
```

Slide 12: Using the Fine-Tuned Model

Now that we have a fine-tuned model, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", model=output_dir, tokenizer=output_dir)

texts = [
    "I absolutely loved this movie! The acting was superb.",
    "This book was a complete waste of time. Terrible plot and characters.",
]

results = classifier(texts)
for text, result in zip(texts, results):
    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {result['label']}, Score: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Customer Review Analysis

Let's use our fine-tuned model to analyze customer reviews for a product.

```python
customer_reviews = [
    "The product arrived on time and works perfectly. Great purchase!",
    "Disappointing quality. It broke after just a week of use.",
    "Average product, nothing special but gets the job done.",
    "Excellent customer service! They quickly resolved my issue.",
]

results = classifier(customer_reviews)
for review, result in zip(customer_reviews, results):
    sentiment = "Positive" if result['label'] == "LABEL_1" else "Negative"
    print(f"Review: {review}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}, Confidence: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```

Slide 14: Real-Life Example: Social Media Sentiment Analysis

Another application of our fine-tuned model is analyzing sentiment in social media posts.

```python
social_media_posts = [
    "Just tried the new restaurant downtown. The food was amazing! #YUM",
    "Stuck in traffic for 2 hours. This city's infrastructure is a joke. #Frustrated",
    "Can't believe how beautiful the sunset is tonight. Nature is incredible!",
    "Another day, another data breach. When will companies take our privacy seriously?",
]

results = classifier(social_media_posts)
for post, result in zip(social_media_posts, results):
    sentiment = "Positive" if result['label'] == "LABEL_1" else "Negative"
    print(f"Post: {post}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}, Confidence: {result['score']:.4f}\n")
```
