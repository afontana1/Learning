Slide 1: Introduction to Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering

Fine-tuning and prompt engineering are two approaches to adapt large language models for specific tasks. Fine-tuning involves retraining the model on task-specific data, while prompt engineering focuses on crafting effective input prompts. This presentation will explore both techniques, their applications, and provide practical examples using Python.

```python
Copyimport torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# Fine-tuning example
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Prompt engineering example
prompt = "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, world!'"
response = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt"))
print(tokenizer.decode(response[0]))
```

Slide 2: Understanding Transformer Models

Transformer models, such as BERT and GPT, use self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. These models have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information effectively.

```python
Copyimport torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_dim, 4 * embed_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(4 * embed_dim, embed_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        attention_out, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = self.norm1(x + attention_out)
        ff_out = self.feed_forward(x)
        return self.norm2(x + ff_out)

# Example usage
embed_dim, num_heads = 256, 8
block = TransformerBlock(embed_dim, num_heads)
x = torch.randn(10, 32, embed_dim)  # (seq_len, batch_size, embed_dim)
output = block(x)
print(output.shape)  # torch.Size([10, 32, 256])
```

Slide 3: Fine-tuning BERT for Text Classification

Fine-tuning BERT involves retraining the pre-trained model on a specific dataset for a particular task. This process adapts the model's knowledge to the target domain while preserving its general language understanding.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch.optim as optim

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Prepare dataset (example)
texts = ["This movie is great!", "I didn't like the book."]
labels = [1, 0]  # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize and encode the dataset
encoded = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
dataset = TensorDataset(encoded['input_ids'], encoded['attention_mask'], torch.tensor(labels))
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2)

# Fine-tuning loop
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

for epoch in range(3):
    for batch in dataloader:
        input_ids, attention_mask, labels = batch
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()

print("Fine-tuning completed")
```

Slide 4: Fine-tuning RoBERTa for Named Entity Recognition

RoBERTa, an optimized version of BERT, can be fine-tuned for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER). This process involves adapting the model to identify and classify named entities in text.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import RobertaForTokenClassification, RobertaTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained RoBERTa model and tokenizer
model = RobertaForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('roberta-base')
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')

# Example text for NER
text = "Apple Inc. was founded by Steve Jobs in Cupertino, California."

# Tokenize the input
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Process the output
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=2)
tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs["input_ids"][0])

# Map predictions to named entities (simplified example)
label_list = ["O", "B-ORG", "I-ORG", "B-PER", "I-PER", "B-LOC", "I-LOC"]
named_entities = [(token, label_list[prediction]) for token, prediction in zip(tokens, predictions[0])]

print(named_entities)
```

Slide 5: Fine-tuning DeBERTa for Question Answering

DeBERTa, an enhanced version of BERT, can be fine-tuned for complex tasks like question answering. This example demonstrates how to adapt DeBERTa to answer questions based on a given context.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import DebertaForQuestionAnswering, DebertaTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained DeBERTa model and tokenizer
model = DebertaForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('microsoft/deberta-base')
tokenizer = DebertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('microsoft/deberta-base')

# Example context and question
context = "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower."
question = "Who is the Eiffel Tower named after?"

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer(question, context, return_tensors="pt")

# Get model predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Process the output to get the answer
answer_start = torch.argmax(outputs.start_logits)
answer_end = torch.argmax(outputs.end_logits) + 1
answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs["input_ids"][0][answer_start:answer_end]))

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```

Slide 6: Fine-tuning GPT-2 for Text Generation

GPT-2, a powerful language model, can be fine-tuned for specific text generation tasks. This example shows how to adapt GPT-2 to generate text in a particular style or domain.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Prepare dataset (example)
train_path = "path/to/your/train.txt"
train_dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path=train_path,
    block_size=128)

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./gpt2-finetuned",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Create Trainer instance
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

print("Fine-tuning completed")
```

Slide 7: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering involves crafting effective input prompts to guide large language models towards desired outputs. This technique allows users to leverage pre-trained models for various tasks without retraining.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

def generate_text(prompt, max_length=100):
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)
    return tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example prompts
prompts = [
    "Translate English to French: 'Hello, how are you?'",
    "Summarize the following text: 'Artificial intelligence has made significant strides in recent years...'",
    "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
]

for prompt in prompts:
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Generated text: {generate_text(prompt)}\n")
```

Slide 8: Crafting Effective Prompts

Effective prompt engineering requires understanding the model's capabilities and limitations. This slide explores techniques for creating prompts that elicit desired responses from language models.

```python
Copyimport openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'  # Replace with your actual API key

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

# Example prompts demonstrating different techniques
prompts = [
    "Explain quantum computing to a 5-year-old.",
    "Write a haiku about artificial intelligence.",
    "List 5 pros and 5 cons of social media use.",
    "Describe the taste of an apple without using the words 'sweet' or 'fruit'.",
]

for prompt in prompts:
    print(f"Prompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Response: {get_completion(prompt)}\n")
```

Slide 9: Few-shot Learning with Prompt Engineering

Few-shot learning allows models to perform tasks with minimal examples. This technique is particularly useful when working with large language models that have broad knowledge but need guidance for specific tasks.

```python
Copyfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import torch

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2-large')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2-large')

def few_shot_learning(examples, query):
    prompt = "\n".join(examples) + "\n" + query
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    attention_mask = torch.ones(input_ids.shape, dtype=torch.long, device=input_ids.device)
    
    output = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        attention_mask=attention_mask,
        max_length=100,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        no_repeat_ngram_size=2,
        do_sample=True,
        top_k=50,
        top_p=0.95,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    return tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

# Example: Sentiment analysis
examples = [
    "Review: This movie was terrible. Sentiment: Negative",
    "Review: I loved the book, it was amazing! Sentiment: Positive",
    "Review: The restaurant was okay, nothing special. Sentiment: Neutral"
]

query = "Review: The concert was mind-blowing, I can't wait to go again! Sentiment:"
result = few_shot_learning(examples, query)
print(result)
```

Slide 10: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique that guides language models to break down complex problems into steps, improving performance on tasks requiring reasoning or multi-step processes.

```python
Copyimport openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'  # Replace with your actual API key

def chain_of_thought_prompt(question):
    prompt = f"""
    Question: {question}
    Let's approach this step-by-step:
    1) First, let's identify the key information in the question.
    2) Next, let's determine what calculation or process we need to perform.
    3) Then, we'll carry out the necessary steps.
    4) Finally, we'll state our conclusion.

    Now, let's solve the problem:
    """
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example question
question = "If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then at 30 mph for 1 hour, what is its average speed for the entire journey?"

answer = chain_of_thought_prompt(question)
print(answer)
```
