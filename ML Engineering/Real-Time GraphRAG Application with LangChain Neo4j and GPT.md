## Real-Time GraphRAG Application with LangChain Neo4j and GPT
Slide 1: Introduction to GraphRAG

GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an innovative approach that combines graph databases, natural language processing, and large language models to extract, organize, and query knowledge from unstructured data. This technology leverages the power of graph structures to represent complex relationships between entities and uses advanced language models to interpret and generate human-like responses.

Slide 2: Source Code for Introduction to GraphRAG

```python
# Simulating a basic GraphRAG structure
class GraphRAG:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}
        self.llm = None  # Placeholder for language model

    def add_node(self, node, attributes):
        self.graph[node] = attributes

    def add_edge(self, node1, node2, relationship):
        if node1 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node1] = {}
        if node2 not in self.graph:
            self.graph[node2] = {}
        self.graph[node1][node2] = relationship

    def query(self, question):
        # Simulate query processing
        return f"Processed query: {question}"

# Usage example
graph_rag = GraphRAG()
graph_rag.add_node("Person", {"name": "John"})
graph_rag.add_node("City", {"name": "New York"})
graph_rag.add_edge("Person", "City", "lives_in")

result = graph_rag.query("Where does John live?")
print(result)
```

Slide 3: Components of RAGraphX v1

RAGraphX v1 integrates several key technologies to create a powerful GraphRAG application. The main components are:

1.  LangChain: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
2.  Neo4j: A graph database management system.
3.  OpenAI GPT: Advanced language models for natural language processing and generation.
4.  Streamlit: A framework for creating web applications with Python.

These components work together to process documents, extract knowledge, store it in a graph structure, and enable natural language querying.

Slide 4: Source Code for Components of RAGraphX v1

```python
# Simulating RAGraphX v1 components
from langchain import LLMChain
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import openai
import streamlit as st

# LangChain setup
llm = LLMChain(prompt="Your prompt here")

# Neo4j setup
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

# OpenAI GPT setup
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

# Streamlit app
def main():
    st.title("RAGraphX v1")
    
    # File uploader
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a PDF file", type="pdf")
    
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        # Process the file (placeholder)
        st.write("Processing file...")

    # Query input
    query = st.text_input("Enter your query")
    if query:
        # Process query (placeholder)
        st.write(f"Processing query: {query}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Slide 5: Document Processing Workflow

The document processing workflow in RAGraphX v1 involves several steps:

1.  PDF Upload: Users upload PDF documents through the Streamlit interface.
2.  Text Extraction: The application extracts text content from the PDFs.
3.  Entity Recognition: Using LangChain and GPT models, the system identifies key entities and relationships in the text.
4.  Graph Creation: Identified entities and relationships are stored in the Neo4j graph database.

This process transforms unstructured document data into a structured, queryable graph representation.

Slide 6: Source Code for Document Processing Workflow

```python
import PyPDF2
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

def process_document(file):
    # Extract text from PDF
    pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    text = ""
    for page in pdf_reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()

    # Entity recognition (simplified)
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    entities = llm("Extract entities from: " + text[:1000])  # Using first 1000 chars as example

    # Store in Neo4j (simplified)
    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
    with driver.session() as session:
        for entity in entities.split(','):
            session.run("CREATE (e:Entity {name: $name})", name=entity.strip())

    return "Document processed and entities stored in graph"

# Usage in Streamlit app
if uploaded_file is not None:
    result = process_document(uploaded_file)
    st.write(result)
```

Slide 7: Natural Language Query Processing

RAGraphX v1 allows users to interact with the stored knowledge using natural language queries. The query processing involves:

1.  Query Input: Users enter their questions in natural language.
2.  Query Translation: The system uses GPT models to translate the natural language query into a Cypher query, which is the query language for Neo4j.
3.  Graph Querying: The generated Cypher query is executed on the Neo4j database.
4.  Response Generation: The retrieved information is processed and formatted into a human-readable response.

This approach enables intuitive interaction with complex graph data structures.

Slide 8: Source Code for Natural Language Query Processing

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

def process_query(query):
    # Translate query to Cypher
    client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Translate the following query to Cypher:"},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ]
    )
    cypher_query = response.choices[0].message.content

    # Execute Cypher query
    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
    with driver.session() as session:
        result = session.run(cypher_query).data()

    # Generate response (simplified)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize this data:"},
            {"role": "user", "content": str(result)}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage in Streamlit app
query = st.text_input("Enter your query")
if query:
    result = process_query(query)
    st.write(result)
```

Slide 9: Real-Life Example: Scientific Literature Review

Consider a researcher using RAGraphX v1 to analyze a large corpus of scientific papers. They upload multiple PDFs of research articles, and the system extracts key information such as authors, institutions, methodologies, and findings. This information is stored in the Neo4j graph, creating a network of interconnected research data.

The researcher can then query this knowledge graph with natural language questions like "What are the recent advancements in CRISPR gene editing?" The system would process this query, search the graph for relevant information, and provide a comprehensive summary of recent CRISPR developments found in the uploaded papers.

Slide 10: Source Code for Scientific Literature Review Example

```python
# Simulating scientific literature review with RAGraphX v1

def process_scientific_papers(papers):
    graph = {}
    for paper in papers:
        # Extract info (simplified)
        info = extract_paper_info(paper)
        # Add to graph
        add_to_graph(graph, info)
    return graph

def extract_paper_info(paper):
    # Simulate extraction using LLM
    llm_response = llm(f"Extract title, authors, and key findings from: {paper[:500]}")
    # Parse LLM response (simplified)
    return parse_llm_response(llm_response)

def add_to_graph(graph, info):
    # Add nodes and edges to graph (simplified)
    graph[info['title']] = {
        'authors': info['authors'],
        'findings': info['findings']
    }

def query_graph(graph, query):
    # Simulate natural language query processing
    relevant_papers = [title for title, data in graph.items() if query.lower() in data['findings'].lower()]
    return f"Relevant papers for '{query}': {', '.join(relevant_papers)}"

# Example usage
papers = ["Paper 1 content...", "Paper 2 content...", "Paper 3 content..."]
knowledge_graph = process_scientific_papers(papers)
result = query_graph(knowledge_graph, "CRISPR gene editing")
print(result)
```

Slide 11: Real-Life Example: Product Recommendation System

Imagine an e-commerce platform implementing RAGraphX v1 to create a sophisticated product recommendation system. The application processes product descriptions, customer reviews, and purchase histories, creating a complex graph of product relationships and customer preferences.

When a customer asks, "What hiking boots are best for rainy conditions?", the system navigates the graph to find boots with high waterproof ratings, positive reviews for wet conditions, and frequently co-purchased with rain gear. It then generates a personalized recommendation based on the customer's past purchases and preferences.

Slide 12: Source Code for Product Recommendation System Example

```python
class ProductRecommendationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.product_graph = {}
        self.customer_preferences = {}

    def add_product(self, product_id, attributes):
        self.product_graph[product_id] = attributes

    def add_customer_preference(self, customer_id, preferences):
        self.customer_preferences[customer_id] = preferences

    def recommend_products(self, query, customer_id):
        # Simulate natural language processing
        keywords = self.extract_keywords(query)
        
        # Find matching products
        matching_products = self.find_matching_products(keywords)
        
        # Personalize recommendations
        personalized_recommendations = self.personalize_recommendations(matching_products, customer_id)
        
        return personalized_recommendations

    def extract_keywords(self, query):
        # Simplified keyword extraction
        return [word.lower() for word in query.split() if len(word) > 3]

    def find_matching_products(self, keywords):
        matching_products = []
        for product_id, attributes in self.product_graph.items():
            if any(keyword in str(attributes).lower() for keyword in keywords):
                matching_products.append(product_id)
        return matching_products

    def personalize_recommendations(self, products, customer_id):
        if customer_id in self.customer_preferences:
            preferences = self.customer_preferences[customer_id]
            return sorted(products, key=lambda p: self.calculate_relevance(p, preferences), reverse=True)
        return products

    def calculate_relevance(self, product_id, preferences):
        # Simplified relevance calculation
        return sum(1 for pref in preferences if pref in str(self.product_graph[product_id]).lower())

# Example usage
recommender = ProductRecommendationSystem()
recommender.add_product("boot1", {"type": "hiking", "features": ["waterproof", "durable"]})
recommender.add_product("boot2", {"type": "hiking", "features": ["lightweight", "breathable"]})
recommender.add_customer_preference("customer1", ["waterproof", "hiking"])

recommendations = recommender.recommend_products("hiking boots for rainy conditions", "customer1")
print(f"Recommended products: {recommendations}")
```

        # Check cache first
        if natural_language_query in self.query_cache:
            return self.query_cache[natural_language_query]

        # Simulate complex query processing
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulating processing time
        result = f"Processed: {natural_language_query}"

        # Cache the result
        self.query_cache[natural_language_query] = result
        return result

    def batch_process(self, queries):
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
            return list(executor.map(self.query, queries))

# Example usage
graph_rag = AdvancedGraphRAG()
graph_rag.add_node("Entity1", {"attribute": "value"})

# Single query
print(graph_rag.query("What is Entity1?"))

# Batch processing
batch_queries = ["Query1", "Query2", "Query3"]
results = graph_rag.batch_process(batch_queries)
print(f"Batch results: {results}")
```
