## Thought-Augmented Reasoning with Buffer of Thoughts with Python
Slide 1: Thought-Augmented Reasoning with Buffer of Thoughts

Thought-Augmented Reasoning with Buffer of Thoughts is an approach to enhance AI models' reasoning capabilities. It combines the strengths of language models with a structured thought process, allowing for more coherent and logical problem-solving. This method introduces a buffer to store intermediate thoughts, enabling the model to break down complex problems into manageable steps.

```python
class ThoughtBuffer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thoughts = []

    def add_thought(self, thought):
        self.thoughts.append(thought)

    def get_thoughts(self):
        return "\n".join(self.thoughts)

buffer = ThoughtBuffer()
buffer.add_thought("First, let's break down the problem.")
buffer.add_thought("Then, we'll analyze each component.")
print(buffer.get_thoughts())
```

Slide 2: The Reasoning Process

The reasoning process in this approach involves iteratively generating thoughts, storing them in the buffer, and using them to inform subsequent steps. This allows the model to maintain context and build upon previous insights, leading to more robust and transparent decision-making.

```python
import random

def generate_thought(context):
    thoughts = [
        "Let's consider the implications of this.",
        "We should explore alternative perspectives.",
        "It's important to validate our assumptions."
    ]
    return random.choice(thoughts)

def reasoning_process(problem, steps):
    buffer = ThoughtBuffer()
    for _ in range(steps):
        thought = generate_thought(buffer.get_thoughts())
        buffer.add_thought(thought)
    return buffer.get_thoughts()

problem = "How can we improve urban transportation?"
result = reasoning_process(problem, 3)
print(result)
```

Slide 3: Implementing the Buffer

The buffer is a crucial component of this approach. It acts as a short-term memory, allowing the model to refer back to previous thoughts and maintain coherence throughout the reasoning process. Let's implement a more advanced buffer with categorization capabilities.

```python
class AdvancedThoughtBuffer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.categories = {}

    def add_thought(self, category, thought):
        if category not in self.categories:
            self.categories[category] = []
        self.categories[category].append(thought)

    def get_thoughts(self, category=None):
        if category:
            return "\n".join(self.categories.get(category, []))
        return "\n".join([f"{cat}:\n" + "\n".join(thoughts) for cat, thoughts in self.categories.items()])

buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()
buffer.add_thought("Analysis", "The current system is inefficient.")
buffer.add_thought("Solution", "Implement a smart traffic management system.")
print(buffer.get_thoughts())
```

Slide 4: Integrating with Language Models

To leverage the power of language models in this approach, we can use them to generate more sophisticated and context-aware thoughts. Here's an example of how we might integrate with a hypothetical language model API:

```python
import requests

def generate_thought_with_lm(context, api_key):
    url = "https://api.languagemodel.com/generate"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
    data = {
        "prompt": f"Given the context: {context}\nGenerate a relevant thought:",
        "max_tokens": 50
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()["generated_text"]

api_key = "your_api_key_here"
context = "We're discussing urban transportation improvements."
thought = generate_thought_with_lm(context, api_key)
print(thought)
```

Slide 5: Structured Reasoning Patterns

To enhance the reasoning process, we can implement structured patterns that guide the model through different stages of problem-solving. Let's create a simple framework for this:

```python
class ReasoningPattern:
    def __init__(self, steps):
        self.steps = steps

    def apply(self, problem, thought_generator):
        buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()
        for step in self.steps:
            thought = thought_generator(f"{step}: {problem}")
            buffer.add_thought(step, thought)
        return buffer

problem_solving_pattern = ReasoningPattern([
    "Define the problem",
    "Gather information",
    "Generate possible solutions",
    "Evaluate solutions",
    "Choose the best solution"
])

def dummy_thought_generator(prompt):
    return f"Thinking about: {prompt}"

result = problem_solving_pattern.apply("How to reduce traffic congestion", dummy_thought_generator)
print(result.get_thoughts())
```

Slide 6: Handling Uncertainty and Ambiguity

Real-world problems often involve uncertainty and ambiguity. Let's implement a mechanism to handle these aspects within our thought-augmented reasoning framework:

```python
import random

class UncertainThought:
    def __init__(self, content, confidence):
        self.content = content
        self.confidence = confidence

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.content} (Confidence: {self.confidence:.2f})"

def generate_uncertain_thought(prompt):
    thoughts = [
        "We could implement congestion pricing",
        "Expanding public transportation might help",
        "Encouraging remote work could reduce traffic"
    ]
    return UncertainThought(random.choice(thoughts), random.random())

buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()
for _ in range(3):
    thought = generate_uncertain_thought("Reducing traffic congestion")
    buffer.add_thought("Possible solutions", str(thought))

print(buffer.get_thoughts("Possible solutions"))
```

Slide 7: Evaluating and Refining Thoughts

An important aspect of thought-augmented reasoning is the ability to evaluate and refine thoughts. Let's implement a simple mechanism for this:

```python
def evaluate_thought(thought, criteria):
    score = sum(criterion(thought) for criterion in criteria)
    return score / len(criteria)

def refinement_step(thoughts, criteria, threshold=0.6):
    evaluated_thoughts = [(thought, evaluate_thought(thought, criteria)) for thought in thoughts]
    refined_thoughts = [thought for thought, score in evaluated_thoughts if score > threshold]
    return refined_thoughts

# Example criteria
relevance = lambda t: 0.8 if "traffic" in t.lower() else 0.2
feasibility = lambda t: 0.7 if "implement" in t.lower() else 0.5

thoughts = [
    "Implement a new traffic light system",
    "Build more roads to reduce congestion",
    "Encourage use of bicycles for short trips"
]

refined = refinement_step(thoughts, [relevance, feasibility])
print("Refined thoughts:", refined)
```

Slide 8: Real-Life Example: Recipe Generation

Let's apply thought-augmented reasoning to generate a recipe. This example demonstrates how the approach can be used in a creative task that requires step-by-step thinking.

```python
class RecipeGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()

    def generate_recipe(self, dish):
        steps = ["Ingredients", "Preparation", "Cooking", "Serving"]
        for step in steps:
            thoughts = self.generate_step_thoughts(dish, step)
            for thought in thoughts:
                self.buffer.add_thought(step, thought)
        return self.buffer.get_thoughts()

    def generate_step_thoughts(self, dish, step):
        # In a real scenario, this would use a language model
        if step == "Ingredients":
            return ["2 eggs", "1 cup flour", "1 cup milk"]
        elif step == "Preparation":
            return ["Mix ingredients in a bowl", "Let batter rest for 30 minutes"]
        elif step == "Cooking":
            return ["Heat a non-stick pan", "Pour batter and cook for 2 minutes each side"]
        elif step == "Serving":
            return ["Serve with your favorite toppings"]

generator = RecipeGenerator()
recipe = generator.generate_recipe("Pancakes")
print(recipe)
```

Slide 9: Collaborative Reasoning

Thought-augmented reasoning can be extended to collaborative scenarios where multiple agents contribute to the thought process. Let's implement a simple collaborative reasoning system:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, expertise):
        self.name = name
        self.expertise = expertise

    def generate_thought(self, context):
        return f"{self.name} ({self.expertise}): Based on my expertise, I think..."

class CollaborativeReasoning:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
        self.buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()

    def collaborate(self, problem, rounds):
        for _ in range(rounds):
            for agent in self.agents:
                thought = agent.generate_thought(self.buffer.get_thoughts())
                self.buffer.add_thought("Collaboration", thought)
        return self.buffer.get_thoughts()

agents = [
    Agent("Alice", "Urban Planning"),
    Agent("Bob", "Transportation Engineering"),
    Agent("Charlie", "Environmental Science")
]

collaborator = CollaborativeReasoning(agents)
result = collaborator.collaborate("How to create a sustainable city transportation system", 2)
print(result)
```

Slide 10: Handling Contradictions and Conflicts

In complex reasoning tasks, contradictions and conflicts between thoughts may arise. Let's implement a mechanism to detect and resolve these issues:

```python
import re

def detect_contradiction(thought1, thought2):
    # Simple contradiction detection based on negation
    negation_patterns = [r"not", r"n't", r"never"]
    for pattern in negation_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, thought1) and not re.search(pattern, thought2):
            return True
        if re.search(pattern, thought2) and not re.search(pattern, thought1):
            return True
    return False

def resolve_conflicts(thoughts):
    resolved_thoughts = []
    for i, thought in enumerate(thoughts):
        contradicts = False
        for other_thought in thoughts[i+1:]:
            if detect_contradiction(thought, other_thought):
                contradicts = True
                break
        if not contradicts:
            resolved_thoughts.append(thought)
    return resolved_thoughts

thoughts = [
    "We should increase public transportation.",
    "We should not focus on public transportation.",
    "Bike lanes are essential for sustainable cities.",
    "Electric vehicles are the future of transportation."
]

resolved = resolve_conflicts(thoughts)
print("Resolved thoughts:", resolved)
```

Slide 11: Visualizing the Thought Process

To better understand and analyze the thought process, we can create visualizations of the thought buffer. Let's use a simple ASCII-based visualization:

```python
def visualize_thought_buffer(buffer):
    max_length = max(len(thought) for thoughts in buffer.categories.values() for thought in thoughts)
    separator = "+" + "-" * (max_length + 2) + "+"
    
    visualization = []
    for category, thoughts in buffer.categories.items():
        visualization.append(separator)
        visualization.append(f"| {category.center(max_length)} |")
        visualization.append(separator)
        for thought in thoughts:
            visualization.append(f"| {thought.ljust(max_length)} |")
        visualization.append(separator)
        visualization.append("")
    
    return "\n".join(visualization)

buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()
buffer.add_thought("Problem", "How to improve air quality in cities?")
buffer.add_thought("Analysis", "Current pollution levels are high")
buffer.add_thought("Solution", "Implement stricter emission standards")
buffer.add_thought("Solution", "Increase green spaces in urban areas")

print(visualize_thought_buffer(buffer))
```

Slide 12: Adaptive Reasoning Strategies

Different problems may require different reasoning strategies. Let's implement an adaptive system that can switch between strategies based on the problem characteristics:

```python
class ReasoningStrategy:
    def apply(self, problem, buffer):
        raise NotImplementedError

class BrainstormStrategy(ReasoningStrategy):
    def apply(self, problem, buffer):
        buffer.add_thought("Brainstorm", "Generate as many ideas as possible")
        buffer.add_thought("Brainstorm", "Don't judge ideas initially")
        buffer.add_thought("Brainstorm", "Combine and improve ideas")

class AnalyticalStrategy(ReasoningStrategy):
    def apply(self, problem, buffer):
        buffer.add_thought("Analysis", "Break down the problem into components")
        buffer.add_thought("Analysis", "Analyze each component systematically")
        buffer.add_thought("Analysis", "Synthesize findings")

class AdaptiveReasoning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {
            "creative": BrainstormStrategy(),
            "analytical": AnalyticalStrategy()
        }

    def solve(self, problem, problem_type):
        buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()
        strategy = self.strategies.get(problem_type, AnalyticalStrategy())
        strategy.apply(problem, buffer)
        return buffer.get_thoughts()

adaptive_reasoner = AdaptiveReasoning()
creative_solution = adaptive_reasoner.solve("Design a new park", "creative")
analytical_solution = adaptive_reasoner.solve("Optimize traffic flow", "analytical")

print("Creative solution:\n", creative_solution)
print("\nAnalytical solution:\n", analytical_solution)
```

Slide 13: Real-Life Example: Event Planning

Let's apply thought-augmented reasoning to a practical task like event planning. This example demonstrates how the approach can be used to break down a complex task into manageable steps.

```python
class EventPlanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.buffer = AdvancedThoughtBuffer()

    def plan_event(self, event_type):
        steps = ["Venue", "Date", "Guest List", "Catering", "Entertainment", "Logistics"]
        for step in steps:
            thoughts = self.generate_step_thoughts(event_type, step)
            for thought in thoughts:
                self.buffer.add_thought(step, thought)
        return self.buffer.get_thoughts()

    def generate_step_thoughts(self, event_type, step):
        # In a real scenario, this would use a language model
        if step == "Venue":
            return ["Research suitable venues", "Consider capacity and amenities"]
        elif step == "Date":
            return ["Check availability of key participants", "Consider seasonal factors"]
        elif step == "Guest List":
            return ["Create initial list", "Send out invitations"]
        elif step == "Catering":
            return ["Determine dietary requirements", "Get quotes from caterers"]
        elif step == "Entertainment":
            return ["Brainstorm entertainment options", "Book performers or activities"]
        elif step == "Logistics":
            return ["Arrange transportation if needed", "Create a detailed timeline"]

planner = EventPlanner()
event_plan = planner.plan_event("Corporate Conference")
print(event_plan)
```
